[Return of the Queen]

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.450
[Episode 12]

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.800
If...

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.240
you don't want our Lu family

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.360
to seize

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.320
your Mare Nubium Hotel Group

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.250
and Cloud Manor,

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.280
then you need to

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:54.620
tell me clearly

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.400
how my brother really died.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.800
You think I killed your brother?

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:05.920
In your mind,

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:07.800
I'm the murderer—

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.240
the one who killed your brother, right?

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.360
I just want to know the truth!

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.080
The truth?

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.100
You want to know the truth?

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.720
Fine,

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.530
I'll tell you the truth.

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:18.320
I never wanted to

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:19.600
kill Lu Sinan.

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.360
It was my newlywed husband—

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.760
your most beloved brother—

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.440
who wanted to kill me.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.000
What did you say?

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.690
[Library Card]

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:52.680
Excuse me,

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.520
I got this book first.

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:55.280
I'm sorry,

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:55.880
[Library Card]

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.040
but I renewed the borrowing period first.

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.960
One month?

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:58.880
Three weeks?

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.730
One week. Just one week.

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:07.840
I can see that your Latin

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.300
has improved a lot lately.

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:10.300
How about this—

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.730
write down a name for me.

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.160
No, no.

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.160
I still need more practice.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.490
My writing is terrible.

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:28.520
Not at all.

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.560
I think

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.360
your Latin writing is
as good as your Chinese now.

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:32.160
You're lying.

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:33.970
If you don't believe me,

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.840
write down your Chinese name

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:35.640
so I can see it.

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.400
Stop trying to trick me into
signing anything.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.000
When we go back to Mare Nubium

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:47.720
and I start handling the documents,

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.520
you'll see plenty of my writing.

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.560
Your brother, Lu Sinan,

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:48.760
orchestrated our meeting

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.010
and tricked me into signing blank papers.

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.080
He wanted to drown me

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.640
in the swimming pool

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.500
at our overseas honeymoon hotel!

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:58.440
Everyone thought

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:00.560
we were a perfect match.

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.080
But no one knew

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.480
that the man I loved completely—

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:08.200
the son-in-law my parents had welcomed

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:09.530
with everything we had,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.130
and the man I thought

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.520
I could be happy with

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:13.320
forever—

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.460
was someone who had been plotting

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.960
against me from the moment we met.

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:20.840
He tricked me into marriage,

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:22.770
swindled me out of my money,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.600
and tried to kill me—

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:25.760
turning our honeymoon

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.240
into a death trap!

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:33.280
You ask

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:35.720
why I escaped from the hospital

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:37.240
despite being badly injured?

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.440
Because your brother wanted to kill me.

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:43.600
You ask why I went to

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.280
a poorly equipped hospital for surgery?

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:46.520
Because your brother wanted to kill me!

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.000
You ask why I didn't dare return

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.320
to China for 3 years?

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:51.040
Because your own brother

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:52.480
wanted to kill me!

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:55.890
That's not true.

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:57.080
No way.

00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:59.600
My brother wasn't that kind of person.

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:00.400
You think

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:01.560
he was really as you described

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.040
in the study?

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:04.400
That he was such a gentle,

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:05.560
kind-hearted person?

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:06.960
He never was!

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:14.040
Your own brother

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:16.360
set a trap from the very start,

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:17.520
using love as bait

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:18.640
to lure me in.

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:20.280
And as for you...

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:22.920
he never treated you

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:24.280
as a real brother.

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:31.370
That's not true.

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:33.080
My brother wasn't like that.

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:34.659
He was always so good to me.

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:35.960
He was always especially good to me!

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:37.560
That was just your illusion!

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:42.760
Your mother

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:44.900
drove his mother to her death.

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:46.800
He was there

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.200
when his stepmother gave birth to you.

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:49.600
How could he possibly care for you?

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:50.320
He didn't want you

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:51.720
involved in the family business

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:54.320
because he wanted to
push you out of the family.

00:06:56.159 --> 00:06:59.080
That's why he had you learn archery
since childhood.

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:00.800
He simply didn't want to see you,

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:01.720
so he used this tiny

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:03.360
championship butterfly medal as an excuse

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:05.560
to keep you trapped abroad for 10 years!

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:07.920
No!

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:16.760
Lu Sinan

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:18.000
was never

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.200
the perfect brother you thought he was.

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:21.800
Nor was he

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:23.600
the perfect husband others saw.

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:28.840
He was just like the rest of your family—

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:31.720
for my family's Mare Nubium,

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:33.840
he used marriage as a trap

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:36.680
to kill me.

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:39.000
That overseas honeymoon...

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:41.760
was never a case of

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:43.620
a rich woman killing her husband,

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:46.250
but rather your Lu family's eldest son

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:48.600

Are you sure she has returned

to Cloud Manor?

00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:00.520
Fortunately, Tan Xin was sharp enough

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:01.780
to have you follow her.

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:03.800
It's good that she went back.

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:05.610
What should we do about Lu Siyu?

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:07.000
Lu Siyu?

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:08.900
Don't bother with him.

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:09.960
Over the next few days,

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:10.920
I'll be at the company

00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:12.000
handling some business.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:12.840
As for Haimeng,

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:14.100
keep a closer eye on her

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:14.760
and watch out for

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:16.220
any strangers around her.

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:17.160
Got it.

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:20.060
Contact me anytime if anything happens.

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:30.160
You're awake.

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:33.320
I don't usually stay up late.

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:34.880
It's already

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:36.680
past my normal bedtime.

00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:38.480
Well, I'm really sorry about that.

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:39.440
You probably won't

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:40.600
get any sleep tonight.

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:41.800
Do we really need to audit

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:42.680
all the construction project finances

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:43.720
from the past 5 years?

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:44.360
Do you think I've pulled you

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:45.480
into overtime

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:46.640
because I have nothing better to do?

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:47.880
No, I don't.

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:49.080
But I think...

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:52.850
you're looking for something.

00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:58.260
What are you trying to say?

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:01.200
Or did someone tell you something?

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:01.860
"Someone?"

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:03.530
Who exactly?

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:05.960
Haimeng?

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:11.440
Stop making wild guesses.

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:12.160
My business

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:13.800
has never had anything to do with Haimeng.

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:15.600
Instead of wasting energy on
these speculations,

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:16.400
you should focus

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:17.440
on your work.

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:18.640
Perhaps

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:20.640
after we finish going through
all these files,

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:21.200
you'll find

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:23.000
the answers you're looking for.

00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:26.700
[Ms. Ye is very beautiful and gentle.]

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:27.540
[I don't believe she's a murderer.]

00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:28.520
[Maybe she was framed.]

00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:29.450
[Or maybe her husband tried to kill her?]

00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:31.450
[Word is, the person who sprayed the car
got caught by the cops.]

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:34.250
[These bad guys should be punished.]

00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:36.000
[Mare Nubium has always belonged to
the Ye family.]

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.000
[The Lu family is staking their claim
and trying to seize her company.]

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.000
[They're pushing Ye Haimeng out.]

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:38.990
[A crowd of shameless fools bullying
a defenseless woman.]

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:42.560
What did

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.730
Ye Haimeng do behind the scenes

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:47.060
to turn public opinion like this?

00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:56.360
Siyue.

00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:57.600
Go get the door.

00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:00.240
What have we come to?

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:01.080
Since when do I,

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:02.240
a daughter of the Lu family,

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:03.970
have to answer the door myself?

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:05.200
Can't believe it.

00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:12.640
Who is it?

00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:14.920
What's with the silence?

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:23.920
Here,

00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:25.360
finish all of this.

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:26.970
You've lost weight.

00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:29.850
While you were away these past few days...

00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:32.780
I've been especially worried about you.

00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:39.800
You don't look

00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:40.920
very well.

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:42.330
Where's Dad?

00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:43.520
Dad would never live with us

00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:44.520
in such a shabby place.

00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:46.240
Stop talking nonsense.

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:50.400
Your dad's not feeling well,

00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:51.640
so he went to a sanatorium.

00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:52.920
There's something wrong

00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:53.960
with our villa,

00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:55.680
so your dad wants us

00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:57.200
to stay here

00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:58.260
just temporarily.

00:13:58.560 --> 00:13:59.120
Mom.

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:03.330
Has something happened...

00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:05.760
to our family?

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:08.160
We can't live

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:09.160
in our huge villa.

00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:10.160
Jiang Lin and Siyue

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:11.880
can't get involved in
our company's business.

00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:13.040
And we're even trying to take over

00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:14.040
Mare Nubium,

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:16.570
which never belonged to us.

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:19.220
That car accident overseas years ago

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:21.640
was never an accident...

00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:26.140
but something
you all planned together, right?

00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:29.920
It was you all who planned it,

00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:31.380
trying to kill Ye Haimeng.

00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:32.920
Lu Siyu!

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:36.440
Who told you this?

00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:41.720
I came back this time

00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:43.620
just to ask you:

00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:44.280
was

00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:46.280
my brother's marriage to Ye Haimeng

00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:47.400
only because she's

00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:49.460
the only daughter of the Ye family...

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:51.480
and the sole heir

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:53.140
to all of her family's wealth?

00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:58.480
As long as my brother could become
the Ye family's son-in-law,

00:14:58.480 --> 00:14:59.880
all their assets,

00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:01.360
including Mare Nubium,

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:04.160
would fall into his
and our family's hands, right?

00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:12.400
These are all rumors

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:13.600
spread by outsiders!

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:15.880
Our family isn't short of money.

00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:17.740
Our overseas investments

00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:18.680
far exceed

00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:19.960
Mare Nubium.

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:22.420
You are a son of our family.

00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:24.520
Are you looking down on your own family

00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:26.040
or your family members?

00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:32.520
I wish this weren't true too.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:36.240
But why was the property custody agreement

00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:37.600
that you've always emphasized

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:38.600
forged

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:39.720
by my brother alone?

00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:40.880
Why would such an important agreement

00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:41.760
be reprinted

00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:42.960
at Mare Nubium?

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:44.320
Why did you immediately

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:45.080
move into Cloud Manor

00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:46.040
after my brother went abroad?

00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:47.280
Why did you have

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:48.800
the property deed to Cloud Manor?

00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:49.920
And even when Ye Haimeng's mother

00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:50.600
suddenly collapsed,

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:51.760
why was she sent to

00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:53.040
our Changlu's private sanatorium?

00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:53.720
Siyu...

00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:55.280
If all this isn't enough,

00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:55.920
then why

00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:57.000
didn't you immediately search for

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:58.160
Sinan and Haimeng

00:15:58.160 --> 00:15:59.200
when the accident suddenly happened?

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:00.600
You had Jiang Lin

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:02.800
hastily settle things
with the overseas police

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:04.720
and quickly moved into Mare Nubium.

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:06.760
Using Sinan's estate management
as an excuse,

00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:08.720
you took over

00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:11.880
the Ye family's Mare Nubium.

00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:14.200
This evidence is enough to prove

00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:17.160
that you plotted everything
from the start.

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:18.560
You deliberately wanted to

00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:20.080
kill the Ye family's only daughter.

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:21.960
You wanted to take over

00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:23.640
Mare Nubium, built on generations

00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:24.970
of the Ye family's toil.

00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:33.000
How could we possibly

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.480
scheme against their only daughter?

00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:36.760
And how could Sinan

00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:38.020
possibly listen to us?

00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:39.440
Who told you all this?

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:40.400
Ye Haimeng?

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:41.400
Mom!

00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:43.960
I just want to ask you—

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:46.760
when my brother Lu Sinan

00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:48.400
proposed to Haimeng,

00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:51.240
did he truly mean it?

00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:58.720
Answer me.

00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:01.840
Mom.

00:17:04.319 --> 00:17:05.079
Lu Siyu.

00:17:06.839 --> 00:17:07.760
Listen up.

00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:09.420
I don't care what you've heard

00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:10.680
from others outside.

00:17:11.079 --> 00:17:12.680
I'll tell you one thing only:

00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:14.660
the one who died abroad

00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:16.839
was the eldest son of our Lu family.

00:17:16.839 --> 00:17:18.770
The one who returned to Mare Nubium

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.200
alive

00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:21.619
was Ye Haimeng.

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:25.520
Whether or not we conspired

00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:26.800
with your brother,

00:17:27.319 --> 00:17:28.200
he

00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:29.600
is dead.

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:32.040
Our Lu family

00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:33.200
has lost a son.

00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:36.130
The property he left behind

00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:39.280
and everything he gained from his marriage

00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:40.920
belong to our family.

00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:43.520
You remember this clearly—

00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:46.850
don't believe the rumors from outsiders.

00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:49.200
We are your family.

00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:51.090
Everything we're doing now

00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:53.720
is for your future.

00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:36.360
Mom,

00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:38.160
how did Siyu find out about everything?

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:38.720
Could it really be

00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:40.120
that Ye Haimeng told him?

00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:43.280
Wouldn't that mean...

00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:46.440
Ye Haimeng knew all along

00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:48.100
that Sinan wanted to kill her?

00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:50.720
It seems

00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:52.930
she knew about it all along.

00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:56.140
That's why she hid away for 3 years

00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:58.320
after being injured,

00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:01.490
waiting until we let our guard down

00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:04.220
before secretly coming back.

00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:10.000
Ye Haimeng actually waited for 3 years.

00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:11.760
That's terrifying.

00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:14.770
Don't panic.

00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:18.160
From Siyu's tone,

00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:20.400
he probably only knows

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:22.000
that Sinan tried to kill her,

00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:23.600
but he doesn't know why.

00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:25.080
So

00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:27.320
we're safe for now.

00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:29.840
But

00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:31.640
what about that person?

00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:32.400
That person?

00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:36.240
Last time at Sinan's funeral...

00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:40.240
Ye Haimeng won't find out about her,
will she?

00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:41.770
I'll make a call right away.

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:51.450
[Unknown number]

00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:58.360
[Unknown number]

00:19:58.550 --> 00:20:00.210
[Unknown number]

00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:05.920
[Mare Nubium]

00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:06.560
Ms. Ye,

00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:07.440
the person who vandalized

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:08.560
your car with spray paint last time,

00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:09.760
has already been arrested by the police.

00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:10.280
Also...

00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:12.240
Are you alright?

00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:12.920
I'm fine.

00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:15.400
You look pale.

00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:16.960
Should I call Ms. Ling

00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:18.720
or your personal doctor?

00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:21.410
What do you need?

00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:23.040
Speak.

00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:24.120
The overseas

00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:25.680
bulk land investment project files

00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:26.920
you asked the Legal Department and me

00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:28.000
to organize last time

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:29.000
are all ready now.

00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:31.280
