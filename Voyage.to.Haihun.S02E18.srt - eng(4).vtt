=Voyage to Haihun, Season 2=

=Episode 18=

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:35.100
Mistress.

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:36.430
Wang Heng killed my father.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.290
It's a hatred that cannot be reconciled.

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:45.680
A man of honor seeks justice,

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:47.150
even if it takes ten years.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.280
What you must do now

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:51.750
is endure.

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:54.350
I'll follow your guidance.

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.040
I heed whatever you say.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:00.760
Remember:

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.150
Never kill with your own hands.

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.150
Instead, we should drive a wedge
between them.

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.840
When Wang Heng leaves Haihun,

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.190
we can step in and reap the benefits.

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.680
You're indeed clever.

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.120
I've followed your instructions

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.600
and swapped the yellow-heart cypress
into Liu He's mausoleum,

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.060
altering the structure.

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.300
I will leak the news

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.250
to Sun Liao at the right moment.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.240
Good.

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.340
Such overstepping is a grave offense.

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.080
With Wang Heng as the overseer,

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:31.360
Sun Liao

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.540
will have to report it to the court.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.320
Liu He won't be able to shield him.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:36.910
Then Wang Heng

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.750
will be forced to leave Haihun

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:41.860
and return to Chang'an
to explain himself.

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:42.840
Rest assured, Mistress.

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:45.030
I will see to it
without the slightest mistake.

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.710
Please let me avenge my father soon.

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:50.190
Rest assured.

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.630
Don't let Wang Heng and Liu He

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.910
notice that you know
about your father's death.

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:59.480
I understand, Mistress.

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.040
Oh, right.

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:03.840
I've learned something else.

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:05.590
What is it?

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.430
Liu Xun may be arriving in Haihun soon.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.920
That is

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.120
wonderful news.

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:26.750
Hurry, move them inside.

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:28.880
Quickly.

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:37.470
Useless lot.

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:39.890
These Horse-hoof Gold

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:40.920
and Qilin-hoof Gold pieces

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.300
are in different sizes and shapes.

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:44.350
How am I to present them
in the Ancestral Temple?

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.400
Do you mean for me
to be deemed unfilial?

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.880
If this keeps up,

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.440
cut off your own hand.

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.150
Marquis, what has happened?

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:55.980
Be careful, all of you.

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:57.360
Leave us.

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:03.560
Marquis, please calm yourself.

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:04.780
Calm down.

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.120
In my opinion,

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.270
if you wish to pay respects
at the Ancestral Temple,

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.290
there's no need
to work yourself to the bone.

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:20.630
What do you mean?

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:23.360
No matter how many things we do,

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.190
it's still not as good

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:27.930
as one word from Wang.

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:30.800
Think about it.

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:33.190
What is Wang's relationship
with His Majesty?

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:37.220
For His Majesty to hold
such a stable position today,

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:38.920
half the credit

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:40.430
goes to Wang.

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:41.870
Surely, you've also heard

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.170
that Wang settled the rebellion

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:45.540
led by the descendants

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:46.680
of the Huo Clan.

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:48.720
To wipe out the Huo Clan,

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:52.360
the evidence Wang presented
struck with deadly precision.

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:53.560
There was no room for denial.

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:55.920
They say

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:59.360
he spent years in secret,
enduring hardships to gather it.

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:01.130
He's truly formidable.

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:05.550
But you're better.

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:09.550
Even someone as shrewd
and calculating as Wang

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.430
still serves by your side
without question.

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:14.670
Marquis.

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:19.260
Wang, this...

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.360
I was just praising you to Marquis.

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:23.260
And here you are.

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:25.940
(I think I've seen
this embroidery before.)

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:29.170
You must be the sorceress.

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:30.960
Hand over the Qilin.

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:34.230
You're not worthy.

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:38.620
You talk with Marquis.

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:40.270
I'm going to keep an eye on the workers.

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:41.390
In such a hurry?

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:43.160
Won't you stay for some tea?

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:44.270
No, no.

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:46.320
Construction is more important.

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:56.700
What do you need?

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:02.870
The Horse-hoof Gold

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:04.370
is not as I remember it.

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:06.800
It looks far too irregular.

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:11.270
How do you remember it looking?

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:13.800
Anything but like this.

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:17.720
What?

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:20.620
Is this also evidence
you gathered in secret?

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:24.190
What did Li Qi tell you?

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:27.240
Nothing much.

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:28.830
He praised you to me.

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:31.490
He said you have a shrewd mind,

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:35.010
gathering evidence
against the Huo Clan in secret

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:36.710
and striking a decisive blow

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:39.150
at the critical moment.

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:42.560
He's implying something.

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:29.430
Why swap the blueprints now?

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:30.940
Even the structure's been changed.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.630
Our previous work went in vain.

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:33.680
Exactly.

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:35.800
The square timber used
to construct the four walls

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:38.420
is all set perpendicular
to the wall panels on the same side.

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:40.430
That makes it far harder to build.

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:41.270
Yeah.

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:43.000
The Marquis is generous.

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:45.360
We just follow the design
and do our job.

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:47.360
No sense turning away from money.

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:49.120
- Right.
- Let's go.

00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:02.100
Yellow-heart cypress.

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:03.730
I just discovered something.

00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:05.830
They're not only brewing powders
to cloud the mind

00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:07.540
but also smuggling yellow-heart cypress.

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:09.220
Yellow-heart cypress arrangement

00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:11.500
is not the structure
meant for a marquis.

00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:14.220
(Why would Li Qi frame the Marquis?)

00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:29.430
Wang.

00:08:36.910 --> 00:08:37.870
This sachet...

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:41.240
This was

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:42.550
given by my father.

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:44.310
I've seen the design

00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:47.200
on a Xiqiang woman.

00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:52.390
You must be mistaken.

00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:53.990
Li Qi.

00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:56.120
Seeing you alive,

00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:58.040
Marquis and I are truly glad.

00:08:59.050 --> 00:09:00.670
Are you hiding something from us?

00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:02.840
Lord Wang.

00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:04.270
What do you mean?

00:09:04.270 --> 00:09:05.660
Marquis treats you with sincerity.

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:08.170
Do not betray his trust.

00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:08.830
I haven't.

00:09:08.830 --> 00:09:11.070
Then why send yellow-heart cypress
into his mausoleum?

00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:13.030
What is your connection
with those from the west?

00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:14.610
What is it you truly seek in Haihun?

00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:16.550
Lord Wang.

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:18.510
I've been wandering these years.

00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:20.480
I don't know what you're talking about.

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:22.030
But you can tell me now.

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:24.190
You've been hiding things from me, too.

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:26.360
Where is my father?

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:29.120
Where is my father now?

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:32.800
Yes.

00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:36.360
Uncle Li took his own life before me.

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:37.390
Before he died...

00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:39.840
Still lying to me?

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.750
You killed my father.

00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:43.460
From the moment you came to Changyi,

00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:44.750
the Marquis believed you.

00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:46.540
Because of you, everyone met their end.

00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:51.590
Lord Wang.

00:09:51.610 --> 00:09:52.550
A letter from Lord Sun.

00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:54.100
He requests your presence at the hall.

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:56.030
Even with all my recklessness,

00:09:56.140 --> 00:09:57.830
how would I dare overstep

00:09:57.830 --> 00:09:59.030
when it comes to the mausoleum?

00:09:59.030 --> 00:10:00.030
Marquis, calm down.

00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:02.690
I've only received
a few anonymous reports.

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:03.870
Everything is still in order.

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:05.840
Besides, don't we still have Lord Wang?

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:07.330
Who would dare

00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:08.470
to frame me?

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:09.530
- This...
- Lord Sun.

00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:11.470
The law applies

00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:12.550
to everyone.

00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:14.240
This is no small matter.

00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:16.110
Should we not handle it
with due formality?

00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:18.240
What do you mean?

00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:21.050
I'm the overseer for the construction.

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:23.480
Scalp Wang handled the materials.

00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:25.200
Clearly, this was aimed straight at me.

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:26.080
So?

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:27.550
I know who is behind this.

00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:34.480
It depends on whether you'll put justice
before kinship.

00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:41.990
Li Qi?

00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:44.870
He must want to do more

00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:47.990
than just turn us against each other.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:48.840
Of course.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.150
There's surely
an even bigger player behind this.

00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:57.000
When the time comes, they'll surface.

00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:01.990
Hold it.

00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:10.630
Lord Sun.

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:16.340
What's this?

00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:17.920
- Seize him.
- Don't move.

00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:19.460
Stay still.

00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:23.010
(Governor's Mansion)
Marquis.

00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:26.110
Using yellow-heart cypress to build
a mausoleum is a grave offense.

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:27.910
If I don't report this,

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:30.600
I'll lose my own head.

00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:36.520
Wang Heng.

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:40.120
Is it you

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:41.560
or him?

00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:42.590
Marquis.

00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:44.730
This has nothing to do with Scalp Wang

00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:45.910
or me.

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:47.880
It's not that I doubt you.

00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:52.580
But I'm truly walking on thin ice now.

00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:54.870
Overstepping is a grave offense.

00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:57.320
I cannot bear such a burden.

00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:59.440
And to avoid it,
would you simply ignore the truth

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:00.670
and frame an innocent man?

00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:02.430
As long as someone takes the blame,

00:12:02.730 --> 00:12:03.790
the two of us will be safe.

00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:04.790
Marquis.

00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:06.630
I had no idea
this was yellow-heart cypress.

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:07.520
Lord Sun.

00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:10.000
He is the true culprit.

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:13.240
This...

00:12:13.250 --> 00:12:15.070
He framed me.

00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:16.440
What punishment does that deserve?

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:18.030
By law, it calls for execution.

00:12:18.030 --> 00:12:18.980
Very well.

00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:20.130
Then we'll end it here.

00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:21.090
But remember this:

00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:23.900
This has nothing to do with Wang Heng

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:25.890
or me.

00:12:25.890 --> 00:12:27.230
Marquis, I'm innocent.

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:28.820
- I'm innocent.
- Innocent?

00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:30.070
Just think of it

00:12:30.410 --> 00:12:31.900
as helping Wang out.

00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:35.520
Take him away.

00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:37.190
- I'm innocent.
- No need.

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:39.910
I am the overseer.

00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:41.990
If blame is due, it falls on me.

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:44.610
I'll go to Chang'an
and beg His Majesty's pardon.

00:12:45.250 --> 00:12:47.600
Wang, why take the blame for others?

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:48.730
Will you take it instead?

00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:57.200
Li Qi.

00:12:57.790 --> 00:12:59.320
Scalp Wang is my brother.

00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:03.200
I'm only doing what a brother should.

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:04.950
You're my brother, too.

00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:08.000
I don't want you to err.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.440
I'm doing what a brother ought to.

00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:12.630
I can't shoulder loyalty
that costs lives.

00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:13.830
Then so be it.

00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:16.560
I don't believe His Majesty
would punish you.

00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:18.400
If there's punishment,

00:13:19.510 --> 00:13:21.420
it will fall on me alone.

00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:26.560
At least,

00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:30.860
His Majesty won't take lives
so lightly as you do.

00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:34.250
- Lord Wang.
- Let's go.

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:35.280
Marquis.

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:36.560
Lord Wang.

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:38.630
No need to sour things with the Marquis.

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:50.360
Did I do wrong?

00:13:52.630 --> 00:13:53.670
Of course not.

00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:04.530
Wang.

00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:05.510
I'm fine.

00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:06.940
It's my fault.

00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:09.000
A good deed turned ill.

00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:12.120
Take care of yourself.

00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:14.160
Yes.

00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:42.030
Li.

00:14:42.410 --> 00:14:44.270
All was within your plan.

00:15:09.190 --> 00:15:11.360
Wang, you're here.

00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:13.490
Lan'er, why are you here?

00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:15.130
Have you found your parents?

00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:16.630
Have a seat.

00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:27.550
Wang.

00:15:28.630 --> 00:15:29.840
I've truly missed you.

00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:30.750
Lan'er.

00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:32.720
I've never had
any improper thoughts about you.

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:33.600
But I have.

00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:37.150
I've always had feelings for you.

00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:39.390
But I've only seen you
as a younger sister.

00:15:39.390 --> 00:15:40.240
That's alright.

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:43.600
A sister is still part of the family.

00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:45.830
But I will never see

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:47.840
the rest of my family again.

00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:49.710
Lan'er.

00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:52.380
What happened in Jingkou Village
is in the past.

00:15:52.670 --> 00:15:54.080
You must let go.

00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:55.790
It's time to move on.

00:15:58.210 --> 00:15:59.630
Mistress was right.

00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:01.790
That is true enlightenment.

00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:04.000
If all of us

00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:06.470
can still live together
in Jingkou Village,

00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:07.840
how blissful that would be.

00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:09.240
The happiness built on gold

00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:11.600
that cannot be spent,
and the false bonds of family?

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:13.030
They're not false at all.

00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:15.600
Every one of them is sincere

00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:17.000
and content.

00:16:17.630 --> 00:16:19.600
Their joy truly comes from within.

00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:22.120
Wang,

00:16:22.630 --> 00:16:24.440
why not admit it?

00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:31.380
Mistress arranged for you

00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:33.390
to go to Jingkou Village.

00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:35.550
Do you know

00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:37.270
why she spared your life?

00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:41.720
You have met Mistress?

00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:46.910
She thinks you share the same fate.

00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:49.570
You're both clever.

00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:55.480
I'm nothing like her.

00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:57.390
I'm not her.

00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:00.510
I don't live
in that self-made void she does.

00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:07.830
At this very moment,

00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:10.030
the promises you made to the people

00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:13.760
and all you strive to create
are nothing but an illusion.

00:17:14.110 --> 00:17:15.590
Why not be like her

00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:17.750
and become the embodiment of hope?

00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:20.310
Hope carries meaning
only when it can be realized.

00:17:21.310 --> 00:17:24.510
Yet those villagers' hopes
can never come true.

00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:27.310
They are merely pawns
for Mistress to use.

00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:29.000
A small state with a few people.

00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:30.400
Harmony across the land.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.400
Was that not proposed
by your wise sages?

00:17:33.950 --> 00:17:35.900
Your Emperors failed,

00:17:35.910 --> 00:17:36.970
yet Mistress has done it.

00:17:37.630 --> 00:17:40.400
This world was meant to be this way.

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:42.270
There is no single way
the world should be.

00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:45.110
Standing firm on solid ground
is the right path.

00:17:47.070 --> 00:17:48.720
You destroyed Jingkou Village.

00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:50.590
You left them with no hope.

00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:53.440
Is this your so-called standing firm?

00:17:54.090 --> 00:17:57.580
Their pain at this very moment
is because of you.

00:17:57.720 --> 00:17:58.560
You

00:17:59.210 --> 00:18:01.040
are the real culprit.
