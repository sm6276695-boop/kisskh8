Didn't you come

00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:54.670

What is it

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:02.750
that you had to arrange a private meeting

00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:03.720

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:05.240

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:06.200

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:07.240
it's been a long time

00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:08.550
since I had a meal alone with you.

00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:19.480
Go ahead.

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:21.340
What do you want to say to me alone?

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:24.600
I want to ask you...

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:26.270
about this.

00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:38.930
Where did you get this?

00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:44.390
Dad!

00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:46.360
So this thing

00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:48.840
really is yours?

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:52.550
It really is the secret ledger

00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:53.510
of Mare Nubium?

00:13:56.030 --> 00:13:57.750
You're here to trick me into talking?

00:13:57.750 --> 00:13:59.270
Using this to threaten me?

00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:07.150
Are you trying

00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:09.150
to get me killed with this,

00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:10.270
or drag the entire Ye family down

00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:11.200
with you?

00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:13.870
Ye Bochen,

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:16.480
you'd better get your head straight.

00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:19.320
You were adopted by me and Xiao Ting

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:22.030
from the orphanage.

00:14:22.030 --> 00:14:23.600
And we raised you

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:25.840
with our own hands!

00:14:26.750 --> 00:14:28.510
Even though we're not

00:14:28.510 --> 00:14:29.720
your biological parents,

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:30.870
we at least deserve

00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:32.320
some gratitude for raising you.

00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:34.720
Instead of showing your gratitude,

00:14:35.510 --> 00:14:37.510
you're biting the hand that fed you!

00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:39.750
Of course I remember

00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:42.320
you and Mom

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:43.000
painstakingly

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.390
raised me.

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:46.720
But

00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:51.610
I've spent the past 20 years

00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:53.360
repaying your kindness.

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:55.000
Is that still not enough?

00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:57.080
What did you say?

00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:04.240
I've been an adopted son

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:05.840
in the Ye family for 20 years.

00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:07.270
Have you ever once

00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:09.720
treated me as your son?

00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:11.510
At home, I've always

00:15:11.510 --> 00:15:12.910
obeyed your every word.

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:15.080
I've been devoted to Mom too.

00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:16.080
I did whatever you told me

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:17.030
to do.

00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:18.360
Whatever life you wanted me to live,

00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:19.360
I lived

00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:20.120
under your direction.

00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:20.840
But

00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:23.790
you've never been satisfied with me.

00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:25.030
Then you should

00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:26.240
reflect on yourself!

00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:27.240
How come everything you did

00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:28.030
could never satisfy me?

00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:28.750
No!

00:15:28.750 --> 00:15:29.720
It's not what I did

00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:30.670
that couldn't satisfy you!

00:15:30.670 --> 00:15:32.080
It's me

00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:34.130
who couldn't satisfy you!

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:35.270
It's because

00:15:35.270 --> 00:15:35.870
my very existence

00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:37.200
is a daily reminder

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:38.240
that your marriage with Mom

00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:39.910
has an irreparable flaw.

00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:40.960
It's because

00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:45.670
although I'm called your son,

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:47.480
I'm also proof

00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:51.390
that you can never have

00:15:51.390 --> 00:15:52.990
a biological son of your own.

00:15:58.030 --> 00:15:59.320
You bastard!

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:05.320
I adopted you from the orphanage,

00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:06.670
raised you for over 20 years,

00:16:06.670 --> 00:16:08.440
gave you the Ye family name,

00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:09.630
just so you can

00:16:09.630 --> 00:16:10.670
humiliate me,

00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:11.510
mock me,

00:16:11.510 --> 00:16:12.910
and betray me here today?

00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:16.630
Ungrateful jerk.

00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:23.360
Talk if you want.

00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:24.960
Don't think hitting your son

00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:26.440
makes you look like a father.

00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:27.600
It's you again.

00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:30.320
This is a private matter of the Ye family.

00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:31.850
It's none of your business.

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:35.480
I have no interest

00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:37.480
in your Ye family's affairs at all,

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:38.000
but...

00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:43.200
You're spineless out there,

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:44.030
so you can only take your anger out

00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:45.390
on your own son.

00:16:45.390 --> 00:16:46.320
Someone like you

00:16:46.750 --> 00:16:48.000
doesn't deserve to be called Father

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.120
by Ye Bochen.

00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:50.510
What did you say?

00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:51.630
Someone like you

00:16:51.630 --> 00:16:52.840
doesn't deserve to be called Father

00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:53.720
by Ye Bochen!

00:16:55.870 --> 00:16:57.510
I'm giving you two options now.

00:16:57.510 --> 00:16:58.270
Either

00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:00.870
go back to Mare Nubium's office tomorrow

00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:01.870
and obediently open

00:17:01.870 --> 00:17:02.870
all those secret flash drives

00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:04.480
in the drawer,

00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:05.550
or

00:17:07.030 --> 00:17:08.760
I'll call the police right now.

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:10.940
And we'll meet at the police station.

00:17:16.510 --> 00:17:17.750
You're threatening me?

00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:18.400
Yes,

00:17:18.829 --> 00:17:20.200
I am threatening you.

00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:21.400
From today onwards,

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:22.680
your opponent is me

00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:23.750
and Mare Nubium,

00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:24.720
not Ye Bochen.

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:26.640
If you ever again despise him

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:27.550
or mistreat him

00:17:27.550 --> 00:17:28.510
because of his background,

00:17:28.510 --> 00:17:29.270
I will

00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:31.070
settle this score

00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:32.270
with you

00:17:32.790 --> 00:17:33.720
bit by bit.

00:17:37.550 --> 00:17:38.280
Come with me.

00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:54.830
There aren't many shops around here.

00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:55.590
Just this.

00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:56.450
Make do with it.

00:18:12.550 --> 00:18:13.680
Feeling better now?

00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:18.680
Actually, I've imagined many times

00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:19.960
how it would be

00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:22.090
to revisit old matters with my father.

00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:24.790
But I never thought

00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:26.960
it would be today,

00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:29.000
here,

00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:34.200
in front of you.

00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:38.640
In front of me,

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:40.440
there's no need to feel ashamed.

00:18:40.750 --> 00:18:41.950
After all, I'm the one

00:18:42.790 --> 00:18:44.650
who pressed you for the password.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.600
It has nothing to do with you.

00:18:49.550 --> 00:18:51.610
The relationship between him and me—

00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:54.750
I've really endured it for far too long.

00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:56.830
Outwardly,

00:18:56.830 --> 00:18:58.350
I'm his nominal son.

00:18:59.350 --> 00:19:00.510
But in this family,

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:03.440
I'm his lifelong shame.

00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:06.000
How could you tell

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.750
our brother and sister-in-law

00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:09.720
that he was adopted from an orphanage?

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:11.440
But that's the reality.

00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:13.030
You never said I couldn't tell anyone.

00:19:13.030 --> 00:19:13.960
What did you say?

00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:15.590
Telling them

00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:16.440
proves

00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:17.830
that I, Ye Yuezhi, am impotent.

00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:19.070
Isn't it the same as telling them

00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:20.350
we can't have a son?

00:19:20.350 --> 00:19:22.480
That we have no heirs
and we're a dead branch?

00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:24.010
How can you think like that?

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:25.880
Bochen is already part of our family.

00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:27.000
He is our son.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:27.920
Bullshit!

00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:29.240
He's just a bastard!

00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:30.720
Every time he stands in front of me,

00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:32.110
I feel like he's slapping me in the face!

00:19:32.110 --> 00:19:33.240
Do you understand?

00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:34.100
Let me tell you!

00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:35.240
Not a single cent

00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:37.240
of my family's wealth will go to him!

00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:41.400
I, Ye Yuezhi,

00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:42.920
have no son!

00:19:44.550 --> 00:19:45.640
From that day on,

00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:47.550
I knew clearly

00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:49.440
that I could never become

00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:50.840
the child he envisioned.

00:19:52.030 --> 00:19:53.920
So I could only carefully

00:19:55.030 --> 00:19:56.480
obey his every word

00:19:56.750 --> 00:19:58.880
and follow every arrangement he made.

00:19:58.880 --> 00:19:59.880
Sometimes, even I myself

00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:00.720
didn't know

00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:02.180
what I was actually doing.

00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:03.240
I didn't know where my future

00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:04.270
lay either.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.000
Sometimes,

00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:08.070
we fall too deep—

00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:11.270
not because
the other person is so captivating

00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:12.830
or manipulative,

00:20:14.350 --> 00:20:16.550
but because we subconsciously believe

00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:19.400
that if we just hold on a little longer,

00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:20.880
if we try a little harder,

00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:23.350
they'll change for us,

00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:25.400
and we can win their favor.

00:20:26.510 --> 00:20:27.350
But Ye Bochen,

00:20:28.550 --> 00:20:29.350
do you know what

00:20:29.350 --> 00:20:30.750
Haimeng's life motto is?

00:20:31.550 --> 00:20:32.240
Haimeng?

00:20:35.030 --> 00:20:36.110
She told me

00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:38.450
her greatest wish in life is

00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:40.750
to see herself.

00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:42.070
To see...

00:20:42.830 --> 00:20:43.640
herself?

00:20:44.270 --> 00:20:45.200
She said

00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:47.510
sometimes we get trapped

00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:48.880
in our original families.

00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:49.720
Sometimes,

00:20:50.270 --> 00:20:51.030
we get trapped

00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:53.430
in our original emotional relationships.

00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:55.880
We always strive outward,

00:20:56.590 --> 00:20:58.250
but often neglect ourselves,

00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:01.090
overlook our own emotional needs,

00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:03.200
and forget that we

00:21:03.550 --> 00:21:04.750
matter too.

00:21:05.030 --> 00:21:06.290
Your adoptive parents

00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:08.210
took you in from the orphanage,

00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:11.270
provided you with food,
clothing, and shelter,

00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:13.330
changed the trajectory of your life,

00:21:13.590 --> 00:21:15.440
and influenced your entire life.

00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:16.300
That kindness—

00:21:16.590 --> 00:21:17.720
you should repay it.

00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:19.890
But the path of your future life

00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:22.450
needs to be walked by yourself.

00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:28.000
The path of my life

00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:31.170
should be walked by myself?

00:21:35.590 --> 00:21:37.190
Take a good look at yourself.

00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:38.750
Ask yourself

00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:40.350
where you want

00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:42.200
to go.

00:21:50.550 --> 00:21:51.400
Be brave!

00:21:52.790 --> 00:21:53.650
Think clearly,

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:54.640
and then

00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:56.310
move forward.

00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:42.480
Madam.

00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:45.400
Madam's journey this time

00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:46.550
will take over 10 hours.

00:22:46.550 --> 00:22:47.550
Pay more attention.

00:22:47.550 --> 00:22:48.920
Don't let Madam get too tired.

00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:49.650
Understood.

00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:53.110
You think by sending me away,

00:22:53.590 --> 00:22:54.880
everything will be over?

00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:56.350
You've misunderstood, Madam.

00:22:56.350 --> 00:22:57.000
Chairman is

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:58.680
just concerned about your migraines.

00:22:58.680 --> 00:22:59.550
This time, he's hired

00:22:59.550 --> 00:23:00.350
better doctors

00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:01.350
and nursing team.

00:23:01.830 --> 00:23:03.230
You make it sound so good.

00:23:03.830 --> 00:23:05.400
You just want to silence me.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:07.800
Getting you medical treatment—

00:23:08.510 --> 00:23:10.000
what's wrong with that?

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:10.640
Fine.

00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:11.920
I'll go.

00:23:12.310 --> 00:23:13.830
I won't appear before you.

00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:14.880
But

00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:16.240
Lu Changdong,

00:23:16.590 --> 00:23:18.000
my son and daughter are

00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:19.640
under your care now.

00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:23.300
Since you're sending me away,

00:23:23.830 --> 00:23:25.490
you'd better treat them well.

00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:27.480
If I hear even the slightest hint

00:23:27.590 --> 00:23:28.590
of trouble concerning them

00:23:28.590 --> 00:23:30.550
while I'm away,

00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:37.580
I'll haunt you even as a ghost.

00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:40.550
Madam,

00:23:40.550 --> 00:23:41.480
we should leave early.

00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:42.240
Don't miss the flight.

00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:43.170
Get out of my way.

00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:04.200
Chairman.

00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:07.440
Send someone to keep a close eye on her.

00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:09.640
Don't return until her plane takes off.

00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:12.510
We can't let her reveal anything

00:24:13.030 --> 00:24:14.790
that would ruin our plans.

00:24:15.270 --> 00:24:16.070
Rest assured.

00:24:16.590 --> 00:24:17.960
When will the people

00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:19.840
from the Middle East arrive?

00:24:20.270 --> 00:24:22.070
I contacted them a few days ago.

00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:23.110
They expressed

00:24:23.110 --> 00:24:24.750
strong interest in collaboration.

00:24:24.750 --> 00:24:25.750
They should formally send the letter

00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:26.830
within a few days.

00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:28.200
Mm.

00:24:29.310 --> 00:24:31.350
Everything hinges on this.

00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:34.030
We don't have much time left.

00:24:36.030 --> 00:24:36.750
Indeed.

00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:38.830
Where is Siyu?

00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:41.350
Siyu...

00:24:41.350 --> 00:24:42.440
went to Xiamen

00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:44.160
for an archery invitational tournament.

00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:45.420
Ye Haimeng is with him.

00:24:46.510 --> 00:24:47.880
Ye Haimeng?

00:24:48.830 --> 00:24:49.310
Of course,

00:24:49.310 --> 00:24:50.030
our people

00:24:50.030 --> 00:24:51.630
have also been keeping tabs.

00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:54.510
She still has the leisure

00:24:54.510 --> 00:24:56.710
to attend an invitational tournament?

00:24:57.480 --> 00:24:58.480
It seems

00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:00.590
the pressure Sinan put on him back then

00:25:00.590 --> 00:25:02.270
was too light.

00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:24.070
Do you have confidence

00:25:24.070 --> 00:25:25.350
in winning this match?

00:25:25.350 --> 00:25:25.950
Of course.

00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:27.110
I've done a lot of targeted training

00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:28.640
for this match.

00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:33.920
Winning this match is something

00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:35.450
I'm determined to achieve.

00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:36.510
Someone you know?

00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:38.200
Mm.

00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:40.200
Just like me,

00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:41.830
he returned from overseas.

00:25:41.830 --> 00:25:42.960
I competed against him

00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:44.680
in university leagues before.
