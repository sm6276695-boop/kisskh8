Don't go after him!

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:44.560
Guan Jie, Tan Xin,

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:45.240
are you here yet?

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.440
Get up here right now.

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:01.680
Siyu.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:02.310
Your hand.

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:02.840
I'm fine.

Haimeng!

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:14.030
Haimeng,

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.760
Does it hurt?

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:17.520
Haimeng.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:31.190
How do you know

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:32.390
the name Zhang Yujie?

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:33.520
She worked at Mare Nubium

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.520
as a financial officer for 20 years.

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.790
She was my uncle's most trusted person.

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:39.630
Even though Ms. Zhang and I

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:40.680
don't know each other,

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.210
I met her only daughter once

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:43.800
back in those days.

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.400
Though your appearance
has changed somewhat,

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.200
I remember this mole on your ear.

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.030
So what if I am her?

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:58.280
So what if I'm not?

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:01.680
Being her

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:02.240
doesn't change

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:03.370
what I have to do now.

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:04.560
And if I'm not,

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:06.630
that still doesn't hide the secrets

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:08.160

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.080
What exactly are you looking for?

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:13.480
What secrets do you have?

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:14.240
Let go!

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:16.450
You must tell me today.

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:18.000
If you don't tell me,

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:19.920
I won't let go.

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.240
If you refuse to tell me,

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:24.360
then I will really

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.480
stand against you.

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:26.870
I'll expose everything

you've been doing here.

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:29.330
I'm looking for money.

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:33.480
Money?

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:34.390
Yes.

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.680
I'm looking for a huge sum of money—

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:37.720
funds secretly siphoned

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.190
from Mare Nubium's Finance Department

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:40.159
ten years ago

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:42.020
and are still missing to this day.

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:44.330
If that money isn't found,

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.120
Mare Nubium will collapse.

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.159
If it isn't found,

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:51.070
someone will have to pay

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:52.630
with their life.

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:19.600
Does it hurt?

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:24.310
No.

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:27.600
This is much better

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:29.790
than the surgical wound.

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:35.780
You're lying to me.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.330
It really doesn't hurt.

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:51.950
But your hand...

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:56.330
You have a match coming up.

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:01.810
What will you do with an injured hand?

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:03.600
They only had table knives.

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:05.330
It's just a superficial wound.

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:06.040
But you...

Please take care of yourself, okay?

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:14.920

00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:11.080
not only left

00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:12.510
that custody agreement.

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:14.320
He had already notarized

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:15.850
his personal will long ago.

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:17.390
To be precise,

00:12:18.030 --> 00:12:19.270
that custody agreement

00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:20.320
was forged by the Lu family

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:21.270
after they received

00:12:21.270 --> 00:12:22.150
Lu Sinan's signature

00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:23.080
on blank paper.

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:24.810
But this notarized will

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:27.200
was personally created by him

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:29.270
witnessed by a professional legal team

00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:31.070
in full compliance with the law.

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:32.240
It is

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:33.570
fully legally binding.

00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:37.200
And in this notarized will,

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:39.670
Lu Sinan left

00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:40.550
all his assets

00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:42.240
to his younger brother.

00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:43.790
That means all the Mare Nubium shares

00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:44.840
he acquired

00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:46.200
through his marriage to you

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:47.550
will go to

00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:50.600
[Lu Siyu inherits
all interests exclusively.]

00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:51.440
Lu Siyu.

00:12:59.450 --> 00:13:01.930
[Lu Siyu inherits
all interests exclusively.]

00:13:07.270 --> 00:13:08.670
Have you verified this?

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:09.670
Where did this document

00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:10.750
come from?

00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:12.040
The Lu family.

00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:13.600
And they didn't just

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:14.720
send it to us.

00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:17.510
They also sent it to the media

00:13:17.510 --> 00:13:19.030
and all parties

00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:22.640
involved in this matter.

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:27.510
The Mare Nubium presidential couple's

00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:28.240
inheritance case

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:29.720
sees a major twist today.

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:31.480
The Lu family
has revealed a notarized will

00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:33.150
personally left by their eldest son
while he was alive.

00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:34.200
The large stake in Mare Nubium,

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:36.120
once thought settled,

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:37.910
may now return to the Lu family.

00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:40.080
Lu Siyu,

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:41.200
inheriting

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:42.670
all of his late brother
Lu Sinan's estate,

00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:43.840
he will become the largest shareholder

00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:44.700
of Mare Nubium.

00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:46.840
The Lu family could reassert control
over Mare Nubium

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:48.900
under the name of their youngest son.

00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:57.550
I always said that one day

00:13:57.550 --> 00:13:59.080
we would fight our way back.

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:00.630
This time when we return,

00:14:00.630 --> 00:14:01.630
we'll not only take back

00:14:01.630 --> 00:14:03.030
the acting presidency of Mare Nubium,

00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:04.840
we'll also storm the board

00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:07.260
and become the largest shareholder.

00:14:07.510 --> 00:14:08.840
Ms. Lu Siyue, Mr. Jiang Lin,

00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:09.790
are you really planning to

00:14:09.790 --> 00:14:11.120
return to Mare Nubium?

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:12.120
Did Mr. Lu Sinan really

00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:13.240
leave all inheritance rights

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:14.720
to his brother Lu Siyu?

00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:15.910
Can the Lu family regain control

00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:17.030
of Mare Nubium

00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:19.230
through Lu Siyu's large shareholding?

00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:22.390
Please share your thoughts.

00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:41.360
Ms. Ye,

00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:42.680
are you alright?

00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:44.390
I'm fine.

00:14:45.270 --> 00:14:46.360
So now,

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:49.630
Lu Siyue and Jiang Lin

00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:51.910
have returned to Mare Nubium

00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:53.510
and taken seats on the board.

00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:56.080
Cloud Manor

00:14:56.510 --> 00:14:58.840
has also been reoccupied

00:14:59.790 --> 00:15:01.320
by Lu Changdong and Chen Mo.

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:04.000
Even though we anticipated

00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:05.870
that probate process for Lu Sinan's estate

00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:07.130
wouldn't go smoothly,

00:15:07.390 --> 00:15:08.750
what was completely unexpected

00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:09.360
was that the Lu family

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:11.030
had another card up their sleeve.

00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:11.960
They've now presented

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:13.000
a notarized will that Lu Sinan

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.260
personally arranged while he was alive.

00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:17.120
The legal effect of this notarized will

00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:17.910
far exceeds

00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:18.600
all the judicial procedures

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:20.130
we've gone through before.

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:22.390
Under the principles

00:15:22.390 --> 00:15:23.720
of spousal inheritance,

00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:25.840
the Lu family does have the right

00:15:26.270 --> 00:15:27.930
to contest and seek a division

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:29.200
of both Mare Nubium's equity

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:30.790
and the ownership of Cloud Manor.

00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:31.910
Moreover, there's now

00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:33.510
an even more crucial figure,

00:15:33.910 --> 00:15:34.870
Lu Siyu.

00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:36.360
Yes.

00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:39.200
He is now Lu Sinan's

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:40.150
sole heir

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:42.410
designated in the notarized will.

00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:44.630
Following the principle
that whoever benefits

00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:46.870
has the strongest motive,

00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:48.750
can we really believe Lu Siyu truly

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:50.840
years ago?

00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:52.480
to participate in the competition

00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:53.840
also directed by the Lu family?

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:54.910
It's quite possible

00:15:54.910 --> 00:15:56.080
that he sent you away on purpose,

00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:57.480
giving the Lu family time

00:15:57.480 --> 00:15:58.270
to seize control of Mare Nubium

00:15:58.270 --> 00:15:59.120
and Cloud Manor

00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:00.000
and gain a tactical advantage.

nothing is impossible.

After four years,

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:12.320
are you going to use the same approach

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:14.000
to trust his own brother?

00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:24.030

tens of billions.

Ke,

this investigation
isn't getting us anywhere.

00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:32.790
Why don't we

00:23:32.790 --> 00:23:34.200
call Haimeng?

00:23:34.590 --> 00:23:35.830
Maybe her uncle told her something

Don't you know what happened

00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:40.480
between Ye Haimeng and me?

00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:42.140
And now you want me to call her?

00:23:47.590 --> 00:23:48.400
Hello?

00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:52.410
What did you say?

00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:00.480
Got it.

00:24:00.830 --> 00:24:01.680
Tell Jie to come up.

00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:03.540
You wait for me at the parking lot.

00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:11.030
Siyu,

00:24:11.350 --> 00:24:12.550
we're not waiting until tomorrow—

00:24:12.550 --> 00:24:13.510
we're leaving now,

00:24:13.510 --> 00:24:14.590
going back to Haijiang tonight.

00:24:14.590 --> 00:24:15.590
Driving on the highway this late,

00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:16.440
won't it be dangerous?

00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:17.200
And we...

00:24:23.270 --> 00:24:23.880
Okay.

00:24:24.510 --> 00:24:25.720
Then I'll go pack our things.

00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:26.680
We're leaving

00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:28.030
all that luggage behind.

00:24:28.030 --> 00:24:29.070
We can leave everything else,

00:24:29.070 --> 00:24:30.600
but we need to take our bows.

00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:31.760
I'll go get them.

00:24:31.790 --> 00:24:33.550
It's too risky for you to go back.

00:24:33.550 --> 00:24:34.400
Wait here.

00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:35.200
I'll get them.

00:24:35.790 --> 00:24:36.350
Siyu,

00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:38.030
you're injured too.

00:24:38.030 --> 00:24:39.240
Jie is already here.

00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:40.310
I'll have him get them.

00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:41.790
Go find Tan Xin at the parking lot.

00:24:41.790 --> 00:24:42.590
Once we get the quivers,

00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:44.450
we'll come find you immediately.

00:24:48.270 --> 00:24:48.880
Alright.

00:24:49.790 --> 00:24:51.030
Be careful.

00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:03.270
Haimeng.

00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:07.070
I'll wait for you.

00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:09.030
No matter what,

00:25:09.550 --> 00:25:10.680
I'll always be here.

00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:51.780
What are you doing?

00:25:58.270 --> 00:25:59.200
Let me go!

00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:02.350
What are you doing?

00:26:02.350 --> 00:26:03.270
Let go!

00:26:03.270 --> 00:26:03.960
Release me!

00:26:04.270 --> 00:26:05.330
Who are you people?

00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:06.790
Let go of me!

00:26:10.030 --> 00:26:10.830
Mo.

00:26:11.310 --> 00:26:12.480
Why are you here?

00:26:13.310 --> 00:26:14.200
These men...

00:26:14.550 --> 00:26:16.310
What are you standing around for?

00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:17.970
Quickly get Siyu into the car.

00:26:21.070 --> 00:26:21.720
I'm not getting in.

00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:22.640
What are you doing?

00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:24.640
Let go!

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:28.720
Let go!

00:26:29.030 --> 00:26:29.960
Let go!

00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:30.640
Jie!

00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:31.790
Lu Siyu is in the car!

00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:49.310
Haimeng!

00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:50.880
Don't follow us!

00:26:52.110 --> 00:26:53.160
Lu Siyu!

00:26:54.030 --> 00:26:54.880
Wait for me!

00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:08.790
go get the car.

00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:11.640
We're going back to Haijiang.
