Today is the wedding day
of the Lord and Hua Yuying.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.040
No outsiders are welcomed.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.879
Looks like I came in time.

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.000
How could this joyous event

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.200
be without me?

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.840
Miss Bai.

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:09.479
We are acquaintances.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:10.719
Take my advice.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:12.800
Don't force things,

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:14.439
or you'll get hurt.

00:02:15.439 --> 00:02:16.719
Yet I insist on forcing it.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.639
Stop me if you can.

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:21.719
Sorry for being rude.

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:24.159
Jiaotu.

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.240
Let her in.

00:02:26.719 --> 00:02:27.240
Yes.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.560
Miss Bai, please.

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:56.520
As expected,

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.039
you came.

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.159
Looks like I came in time.

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:16.080
Ye Chenyuan.

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.759
Do you know how childish you are?

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.479
You hold this wedding

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:21.560
just to fool me

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:23.000
and make me back down.

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:25.039
But doing so

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:26.919
proves things are abnormal.

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:31.759
Are you that shameless

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:34.719
with no self-awareness at all?

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.800
If I hadn't needed you
to unseal the Divine Sword,

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.159
I'd have married her long ago.

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.479
Then why didn't you marry her back then?

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:49.000
I was under her control,

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:51.560
so I needed your power.

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:58.719
This is what we Night Clan are.

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:01.919
We can fight against each other today,

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.400
and then talk sweetly the next day.

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:07.560
We don't bother with petty morals.

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:08.960
Our code is simple.

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:12.479
Winner takes all.

00:04:15.719 --> 00:04:16.560
I don't believe it.

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:20.160
Impossible.

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:26.160
I had to put on a full play.

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.600
Without feigning,

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.319
how could you believe
my love is genuine?

00:04:31.839 --> 00:04:32.560
Moreover,

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:34.600
only by experience

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.800
the profound loss and guilt with you

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.120
would you help me.

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:47.759
So that night

00:04:50.839 --> 00:04:52.079
was all a lie?

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:57.879
Of course.

00:05:05.839 --> 00:05:06.920
Look me in the eyes.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.279
Don't you dare do it?

00:05:23.319 --> 00:05:24.720
Say something!

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:29.459
Enough talk!

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.639
Do you think
you can take my man like this?

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:34.720
You have to defeat me first.

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:41.459
You said it.

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:44.220
If you lose,

00:05:44.939 --> 00:05:45.779
he'll be mine.

00:06:07.339 --> 00:06:08.060
Are you okay?

00:06:08.459 --> 00:06:09.379
No.

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:12.379

Xiaoying!

00:14:07.919 --> 00:14:08.759
Say something.

will make me back off?

00:14:11.559 --> 00:14:12.399
Never.

00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:14.399
Go confess your sins to the immortals

00:14:14.399 --> 00:14:15.679
and quit being the Sword Master.

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:16.159

What I said is true.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.720
Her repeated incompetence
caused disasters.

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:25.840
And you always clean up her messes.

00:14:26.159 --> 00:14:27.679
She can't be the Sword Master anymore.

00:14:27.679 --> 00:14:28.639
Then what have you done?

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:33.720
Xiaoying retrieved the sword crystal

00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:35.620
and stopped the Night Clan's atrocities.

00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:37.440
She risks her life every time,

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:38.600
yet you turn a blind eye.

00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:40.840
You only fixate on her mistakes.

00:14:41.679 --> 00:14:42.919
You accuse me of defending her.

00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:44.440
Fine.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.080
I'm defending her.

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:48.200
From now on, opposing Xiaoying

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:49.960
means opposing me.

00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:50.919
Yunya!

00:14:51.759 --> 00:14:53.120
Do you know what you're doing?

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:56.159
She has bewitched you.

00:14:56.279 --> 00:14:57.480
And you are different now.

00:14:58.759 --> 00:14:59.200
Rourou,

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:00.159
escort them out.

00:15:00.399 --> 00:15:01.960
Seniors, please.

00:15:11.639 --> 00:15:12.200
Xiaoying.

00:15:24.039 --> 00:15:25.759
Do you know what you've become?

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:28.679
Are you still the Bai Xiaoying I know?

00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:32.279
Was ruining yourself
for Ye Chenyuan worth it?

00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:37.200
Sword...

00:15:38.639 --> 00:15:39.360
What?

00:15:41.759 --> 00:15:43.080
I need the Divine Sword

00:15:44.039 --> 00:15:45.559
to kill Night Deity.

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:50.000
Master.

00:15:51.759 --> 00:15:53.879
I'll reclaim the Divine Sword.

00:15:56.679 --> 00:15:57.759
Good.

00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:09.960
My lord.

00:16:10.679 --> 00:16:12.096
Xiaoying broke rules leaving,

00:16:12.096 --> 00:16:13.616
yet her goal was to reclaim the Sword.

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:15.399
Please forgive her.

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:19.879
As the Sword Master,

00:16:21.139 --> 00:16:22.860
Bai Xiaoying lost the Divine Sword

00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:25.039
and went to crash
the Night Clan's wedding.

00:16:25.799 --> 00:16:27.279
She's such a shame!

00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:30.379
Even if I forgave her,

00:16:30.759 --> 00:16:32.240
would other immortals forgive her

00:16:32.919 --> 00:16:34.600
and the Three Realms spare her?

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:35.659
My lord.

00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:38.019
There must be a way to make up for that.

00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:40.860
I'd do everything.

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:43.399
Do you truly want to save her?

00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:44.240
Yes.

00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:46.019
Alright.

00:16:46.679 --> 00:16:47.480
Follow me.

00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:17.000
It's the immortal sect's
forbidden technique, Sanqing Art.

00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:20.400
It can multiply your cultivation
tenfold instantly,

00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:23.079
but also comes with side effects.

00:17:23.759 --> 00:17:24.960
You might become crippled.

00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:27.160
At worst, you would lose your souls.

00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:31.039
If we want to reclaim the Divine Sword
from Ye Chenyuan,

00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:34.839
we can only take this risk.

00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:38.880
I thought to have Bai Xiaoying
use this forbidden technique,

00:17:39.559 --> 00:17:40.359
but...

00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:41.039
My lord,

00:17:41.759 --> 00:17:43.640
I'll go reclaim the Divine Sword.

00:17:44.319 --> 00:17:46.000
Have you thought it through?

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:47.640
No matter what,

00:17:48.319 --> 00:17:48.880
I will

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:50.039
fulfill the task.

00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:58.080
(Sanqing Art)

00:18:32.559 --> 00:18:34.680
So you came to seek death today?

00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:36.119
I came here

00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:37.960
to reclaim the Divine Sword,

00:18:38.519 --> 00:18:39.880
and to avenge Xiaoying!

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:42.440
If you don't cherish her,

00:18:42.759 --> 00:18:44.000
you should stay away from her.

00:18:44.559 --> 00:18:45.240
Today,

00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:48.799
I'll make you pay for what you've done.

00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:50.920
You?

00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:52.440
Yes, me.

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:17.119
Seems you'll die here today.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.200
I'll have Bai Xiaoying
collect your corpse.

00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:25.279
Don't say her name.

00:19:30.079 --> 00:19:31.799
You came prepared.

00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:50.480
Why is the Divine Sword here?

00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:02.680
Master!

00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:06.000
Stop!

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:06.848
(Yunxiu Pavilion)

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:09.799
I need to go in.

00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:11.240
Master won't see anyone now.

00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:12.519
(Wait.)

00:22:13.559 --> 00:22:15.720
(I've never seen Yunxiu Pavilion
this heavily guarded.)

00:22:16.599 --> 00:22:17.680
(Something's off.)

00:22:18.119 --> 00:22:18.960
I must see him.

00:22:19.839 --> 00:22:20.240
Stop!

00:22:22.759 --> 00:22:23.400
What now?

00:22:23.759 --> 00:22:24.599
Internal strife?

00:22:26.839 --> 00:22:27.680
Yongning,

00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:30.160
I know Master reclaimed
the Divine Sword for me.

00:22:31.279 --> 00:22:33.119
But the Yunxiu Pavilion
is heavily guarded,

00:22:33.519 --> 00:22:34.920
something must have happened.

00:22:35.759 --> 00:22:37.319
As his best friend,

00:22:37.319 --> 00:22:38.599
you must know what happened.

00:22:39.279 --> 00:22:40.519
Please tell me.

00:22:44.759 --> 00:22:45.559
Come with me.

00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:02.359
He knows you will know it,

00:23:03.839 --> 00:23:05.680
but wants to delay as long as possible.

00:23:06.559 --> 00:23:08.400
He doesn't want you
to see him like this.

00:23:26.119 --> 00:23:27.039
Why?

00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:30.680
Why would he be like this?

00:23:32.279 --> 00:23:33.160
For you,

00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:35.680
in order to defeat Ye Chenyuan,

00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:38.079
he risked using the forbidden technique

00:23:38.839 --> 00:23:40.799
and went alone to reclaim the sword.

00:23:42.119 --> 00:23:43.720
It's a blessing to lose one of his arms.

00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:47.759
Now his immortal consciousness fades
and his spiritual power vanishes.

00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:50.559
Even Xiyuan can't do anything.

00:23:52.119 --> 00:23:54.480
He'll likely remain like this forever.

00:23:57.480 --> 00:23:58.119
No way.

00:23:59.519 --> 00:24:00.200
No way.

00:24:07.519 --> 00:24:08.160
Master.

00:24:10.559 --> 00:24:11.319
Master.

00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:22.400
Master.

00:24:29.799 --> 00:24:30.240
No!

00:24:31.559 --> 00:24:32.000
No!

00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:38.160
Wanyan was right.

00:24:42.279 --> 00:24:45.279
I kept causing Master trouble.

00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:50.279
It's all my fault.

00:24:56.559 --> 00:24:57.480
Master.

00:24:57.720 --> 00:24:58.720
I'm sorry.

00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:01.160
Sorry, Master.

00:25:02.119 --> 00:25:04.079
It's all my fault.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:22.079
Ye Chenyuan.

00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:26.240
Ye Chenyuan.

00:25:32.559 --> 00:25:33.960
Ye Chenyuan.

00:25:35.799 --> 00:25:37.240
From now on,

00:25:39.119 --> 00:25:41.640
I will be your sworn enemy!

00:25:43.359 --> 00:25:45.960
I will never let you go!

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.279
I am Bai Xiaoying,
Sword Master of Nine Heavens.

00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:00.880
I came here
to take vengeance on Ye Chenyuan.

00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:03.039
If he doesn't come out,

00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:04.720
then

00:26:05.359 --> 00:26:07.440
I'll wipe out all of you!

00:26:35.599 --> 00:26:36.480
Ye Chenyuan.

00:26:38.559 --> 00:26:38.920
No.

00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:41.359
Night Deity.

00:26:43.599 --> 00:26:44.759
We meet again.

00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:48.039
Like your master,

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:50.599
came uninvited.

00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:54.640
You Nine Heavens people are funny.

00:26:54.759 --> 00:26:56.079
Don't say his name.

00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:00.799
For ten years,

00:27:02.599 --> 00:27:05.440
I've imagined countless times
how I'd kill the Night Deity.

00:27:07.839 --> 00:27:09.720
But I never expected when the day came,

00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:12.599
I would be so sad.

00:27:18.759 --> 00:27:19.559
Ye Chenyuan.

00:27:21.319 --> 00:27:23.079
I don't care what reasons you have.

00:27:24.759 --> 00:27:26.880
We sever ties

00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:28.039
here!

00:27:30.079 --> 00:27:31.039
Today,

00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:34.720
I will seek justice for my master!

00:27:35.279 --> 00:27:36.519
I see.

00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:39.400
No matter how I tortured you,

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:41.799
you remained composed.

00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:44.359
It's all because of your master.

00:27:46.279 --> 00:27:48.680
Looks like Yunya

00:27:49.799 --> 00:27:51.039
is your true vulnerability.

00:27:52.839 --> 00:27:53.839
So what?

00:27:55.079 --> 00:27:55.880
Perfect.

00:27:56.480 --> 00:27:58.039
Let's settle all our grudges

00:27:58.640 --> 00:27:59.640
at once.

00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:01.200
Fine.

00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:03.400
Today,

00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:06.240
let's end all this.

00:28:57.440 --> 00:28:58.359
