You called Lu Siyu?

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:11.000
You already knew

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.530
about them being together?

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:13.430
Just like you,

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.160
I just saw it happen.

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:17.400
It's no big deal

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:19.750
that they're together.

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:20.550
Not a big deal?

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:24.120
Before Haimeng returned,

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.280
she clearly told me

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:26.590
the purpose of her return

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.360
was to take back Mare Nubium

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.079
and uncover the truth.

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:32.000
But what is she doing now?

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.590
She and Lu Siyu—

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:33.800
Haven't you already achieved

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.030
what you planned?

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:36.470
The truth you wanted

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.030
has all come to light tonight.

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:39.310
Come to light?

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:40.190
Mare Nubium has already returned

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:41.320
to Haimeng's hands.

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:43.150
Tonight, you all saw

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.240
that Lu Sinan had someone else he loved.

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:46.280
That marriage

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.960
was just a stepping stone

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.820
to a scheme against the Ye family.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.750
Is that

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:51.590
all there is to it?

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:52.430
What else?

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:53.910
Do you want Haimeng

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:55.710
to be trapped in that marriage forever?

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:56.400
Let alone that Sinan

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.520
has been dead for four years,

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:58.710
Haimeng was the victim

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:00.150
in that marriage.

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.150
Now that everything

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:02.630
has come to light,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.560
as her cousin and friend,

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.840
I hope she can

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.240
let go of everything soon

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:08.870
and return to her normal life.

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:10.080
So your idea of letting her return
to a normal life

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.910
is just watching her

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:11.430
be with Lu Siyu?

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:12.910
Isn't Siyu good enough?

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:19.839
Between the two Lu brothers,

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:22.920
I didn't have much contact with Sinan,

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:24.380
but I know Siyu quite well.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.950
Although he is

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:27.610
the youngest in the Lu family,

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:29.430
he has always been pure.

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:30.430
He's never been caught

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:31.430
in the whirl of wealth,

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:32.070
nor tainted

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:33.600
by social games.

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:34.720
Everything he has achieved—

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.040
all his accomplishments and honors—

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.390
is the result of his own effort.

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:38.590
Isn't a Siyu like that

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.200
truly worthy of Haimeng?

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:41.360
Should we be discussing

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:42.240
whether he is worthy

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:42.870
or not worthy

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:43.800
of Haimeng right now?

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.000
Then what is the issue?

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.040
Lu Sinan is a Lu,

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.510
and so is Lu Siyu.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:48.750
Someone from the Lu family

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.409
has already crushed her once.

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:51.680
Now that she has another shot,

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:52.360
should she risk diving

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:53.870
into the Lu family's fire again?

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:55.600
Don't just look at
whether they're compatible or not

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:56.870
on the surface.

00:04:57.159 --> 00:04:57.720
If you really are

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.380
Haimeng's cousin and friend,

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.000
you should persuade her

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:03.630
to get out of the Lu family chaos
as soon as she can.

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:04.830
Don't let her make

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:06.510
the same mistake over and over again.

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:07.070
But—

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.800
Cut it out.

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.460
I don't want to comment on Lu Siyu.

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.000
And I don't want him to ever appear

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.400
in Haimeng's life again.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:15.680
That's it.

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:21.390
Ling Ke.

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:22.750

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:32.490
Why have I never seen

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:34.070
this painting before?

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:36.159
Your brother commissioned it

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:37.360
for Ms. Ye

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:38.630
before their wedding.

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:40.680
It was a token of love

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:42.210
between Sinan and Haimeng?

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:44.400
It's more than just a love token.

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:45.720
It bound

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:46.980
their fates together.

Chen Mo.

00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:59.840
The chairman is already aware of

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:01.030
the recent family incidents.

00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:02.320
This time, he returned from the sanatorium

Therefore,

00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:05.360
I will now announce

the following decisions on his behalf:

00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:08.630
Starting tomorrow, Siyue and Jiang Lin

00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:09.720
will move out

of the Lu Mansion

00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:12.200
and establish their own household.

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:13.320
Jiang Lin can come with me

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:14.080
to Changlu

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:16.520

00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:18.360
Siyu,

00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:20.000
you are

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.080
to liquidate all domestic investments
within this week.

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:22.910
Next week, someone will escort you

00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:25.840
As for Madam,

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:28.030
lawyers will assist you

As the Lu family's mistress,

00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:42.200
you have neither run
the household responsibly

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:44.200
nor raised your children properly,

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:45.870
and you even instigated Sinan

00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:47.600
to commit horrible deeds.

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:49.910
How can the Lu family keep you?

Do you have any evidence?

00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:54.600
Lu Sinan is your son

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:55.750
with your ex-wife.

00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:56.360
All these years,

00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:57.790
he never treated me as his mother.

00:09:57.790 --> 00:09:59.600
He only held resentment toward me.

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:01.200
He's the eldest son of the Lu family—

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:02.670
why would I try to manipulate him?

00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:04.440
And why would he even listen to me?

00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:06.390
So now that Sinan is gone,

00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:08.470
you're pushing all the blame

00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:10.080
onto him?

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:11.270
What blame am I pushing onto him?

00:10:11.270 --> 00:10:13.080
Did I force him
to fall in love with Ye Haimeng,

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:13.960
or did I force him

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:15.120
to marry her?

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:20.080
It was your precious eldest son

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:22.320
who plotted against
the Ye's only daughter,

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:23.390
doing everything he could

00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:24.840
to trick her into marriage,

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:26.720
and then using marital rights

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:28.120
to seize her family's fortune.

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:29.240
These were all

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:30.240
Lu Sinan's own plans.

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:31.480
What does it have to do with me?

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:32.960
Nothing to do with you?

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:34.940
That's easy for you to say.

00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:36.880
If you had nothing to do with it,

00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:37.600
then why did Ye Haimeng

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:38.840
come looking for you?

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:40.270
Why did Ye Haimeng present

00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:41.390
at Lu Sinan's funeral

00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:43.000
with so much evidence?

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:44.790
And why was that evidence

00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:46.080
all over the news?

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:47.510
Are you blind,

00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:48.750
or am I blind?

00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:50.210
Or is everyone else blind?

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:51.960
The reporters made it all up.

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:53.550
Siyue and I didn't do anything.

00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:54.600
We were just following

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:55.510
Sinan's will

00:10:55.510 --> 00:10:57.200
and handling his funeral arrangements.

00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:58.670
Yet you, his own father,

00:10:58.670 --> 00:11:00.000
show no gratitude

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.150
and pin all the blame

00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:02.510
on me.

00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:03.550
It's no surprise Sinan could do

00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:04.550
something like that,

00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:06.200
given a father like you.

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:06.910
What did you say?

00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:07.670
I said,

00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:08.960
all these years

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:10.960
you've neglected to discipline Lu Sinan.

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:12.080
You didn't even know

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:13.030
he got married

00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:13.840
or had children,

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:14.960
matters of such importance.

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:16.600
That's why he dared to murder

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:17.910
someone else's daughter.

00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:19.150
What nonsense are you talking about?

00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:20.600
I'm not talking nonsense.

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:22.870
A father who fails to guide his son
is to blame.

00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:24.910
Every single one of Lu Sinan's schemes
to murder his wife

00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:26.320
came from you!

00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:27.240
You...

00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:28.630
Don't hit my mom!

00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:54.840
Dad.

00:11:55.910 --> 00:11:56.870
All these years,

00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:59.320
you've been completely focused on
Changlu Group,

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:00.480
while all the household matters

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:02.210
have been handled by Mom alone.

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:04.910
The Lu family has survived until now

00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:06.670
thanks entirely to Mom.

00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:10.120
How could you say

00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:12.720
that Sinan was instigated by Mom?

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:16.000
Yes,

00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:18.480
Mom is your second wife.

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:20.030
So since she first arrived,

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:22.030
Sinan never once

00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:22.890
called her Mom.

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:23.840
How could he possibly

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:25.360
have listened to her?

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:28.840
On the contrary, Lu Sinan

00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:31.360
never considered us

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:33.030
his family.

00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:36.360
I still remember

00:12:37.510 --> 00:12:39.170
how much he hated me as a child.

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:40.840
He even said

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:42.800
that in the next life,

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:43.790
he still wouldn't recognize us

00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:45.150
as siblings.

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:47.910
And when it comes to Siyu,

00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:50.230
he went even further.

00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:54.440
Sinan always hated Siyu the most.

00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:56.630
Don't you all know that?

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:04.330
Siyu was just a little kid then.

00:13:04.630 --> 00:13:06.320
He didn't understand anything.

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:07.480
But I did.

00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:09.270
Since Siyu was seven,

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:11.630
he kept telling Uncle Mo

00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:14.160
to kick Siyu out of the Lu family.

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:16.240
He never wanted Siyu
to have the Lu surname,

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:17.360
or to get his hands on

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:18.690
the Lu family business.

00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:21.750
All that talk about archery championships

00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:23.510
and bringing honor to the family—

00:13:23.510 --> 00:13:24.910
those were just excuses.

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:26.200
He didn't want

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:27.630
Siyu to stay in China.

00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:29.910
He hated his half-brother,
the son of his stepmother.

00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:31.480
He hated Siyu!

00:13:34.270 --> 00:13:35.120
Chen Mo,

00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:37.750
what Siyue said

00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:39.600
is all true?

00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:41.630
Sinan

00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:43.560
indeed didn't like Siyu very much.

00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:44.790
Probably because

00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:47.290
they have different mothers.

00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:55.670
There's no need to act this way.

00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:58.180
Of the three children in this family,

00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:00.080
which one have you ever truly cared for?

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:01.000
The Lu family

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.720
has come to this today

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:05.840
all because of you.

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:07.150
Dad,

00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:09.430
you can't drive Mom away.

00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:11.440
If you drive Mom away,

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.150
then I'll leave too.

00:14:13.630 --> 00:14:15.000
I'll take Siyu with me,

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:17.600
and we'll never use the Lu surname again.

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:18.320
Lu Siyu.

00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:20.120
Say something.

00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:23.150
Say something, Siyu.

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:26.200
Siyu!

00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:29.360
Siyu, say something!

00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:32.670
Siyu!

00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:38.840
Chen Mo,

00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:41.000
keep an eye on him.

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:42.550
The Lu family has already

00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:43.600
lost one son.

00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:45.390
We can't lose another.

00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:47.360
Send someone

00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:49.040
to get him out of here.

00:15:06.350 --> 00:15:08.190
[Kid]

00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:13.020
[Kid]

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:17.480
Hello.

00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:20.160
You're awake.

00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:21.270
Mm.

00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:23.760
Are you feeling uncomfortable?

00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:25.850
Does your old wound still hurt?

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:29.860
No, it doesn't.

00:15:30.750 --> 00:15:31.960
If it hurts again,

00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:33.270
there are painkillers

00:15:33.270 --> 00:15:34.150

you weren't actually

a publicly recruited volunteer
at that hospital.

00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:57.700

you were following me

Haimeng,

00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:09.400

00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:18.930
I'll ask you.

00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:27.050
In the past few days,

00:21:27.270 --> 00:21:29.680
the Lu family has gone through
major changes.

00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:30.940
Do you know about them?

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:31.880
What changes?

00:21:32.350 --> 00:21:33.720
Du Meiyun was ordered by Lu Changdong

00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:35.350
to divorce and leave the family.

00:21:35.350 --> 00:21:36.270
Lu Siyue and Jiang Lin

00:21:36.270 --> 00:21:38.330
have also moved out of the Lu Mansion.

00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:39.720
Tonight,

00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:42.000
the youngest son of the Lu family,

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:42.750
Lu Siyu,

00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:44.030
will be sent abroad

00:21:44.030 --> 00:21:45.490
by Lu Changdong's people.

00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:49.640
What a mess.

00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:51.480
So Changlu

00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:52.440
must now be left

00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:54.200
with only Lu Changdong?

00:21:56.030 --> 00:21:57.290
There's still Chen Mo.

00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:00.940
Chen Mo is still there.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:05.260
Aren't you surprised?

00:22:06.830 --> 00:22:08.090
Surprised about what?

00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:11.480
The youngest son of the Lu family

00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:12.310
is leaving.

00:22:16.790 --> 00:22:18.350
No need to beat around the bush.

00:22:18.350 --> 00:22:19.680
You just want to ask me

00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:21.480
why I kissed Lu Siyu

00:22:21.790 --> 00:22:22.960
that night

00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:24.590
under the tree.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:26.070
He's from the Lu family.

00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:27.830
He's Lu Sinan's own brother.

00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:29.920
That night,

00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:31.240
in that moment,

00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:32.270
I wanted to kiss him,

00:22:32.270 --> 00:22:33.030
so I did.

00:22:34.030 --> 00:22:35.360
I didn't care who he was,

00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:36.550
or whether

00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:38.440
he was Lu Sinan's brother.

00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:39.550
Haimeng,

00:22:39.550 --> 00:22:40.750
I know you don't care,

00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:42.790
but others definitely will.

00:22:42.790 --> 00:22:43.720
The Lu family

00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:44.960
will certainly care.

00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:46.640
My business

00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:48.580
has nothing to do with others.

00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:50.700
I've already reclaimed Mare Nubium,

00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:51.640
and I have no ties

00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:52.790
to Lu Sinan anymore.

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:54.590
What I need to do now

00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:56.830
is to live my own life well.

00:22:56.830 --> 00:22:58.560
I don't care what others think.

00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:00.680
I only follow my heart.

00:23:01.270 --> 00:23:02.590
If I'm good to someone,

00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:05.110
it's only because I want to be.

00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:07.160
If I like someone,

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:09.200
it's simply

00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:11.330
because I like them.

00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:13.160
Haimeng,

00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:13.880
I...

00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:14.790
Don't worry.

00:23:14.790 --> 00:23:15.880
I know

00:23:16.590 --> 00:23:17.310
what I want.

00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:40.720
Ms. Ye,

00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:41.790
there's a visitor downstairs.

00:23:41.790 --> 00:23:43.320
She says she's your friend.

00:23:43.750 --> 00:23:44.830
My friend?

00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:08.790
Is this

00:24:08.790 --> 00:24:09.990
where he used to live?

00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:12.270
It looks like his style.

00:24:12.750 --> 00:24:14.070
Are you here to gloat?

00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:15.680
This

00:24:16.110 --> 00:24:17.310
is my home.

00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:23.030
Ms. Ye,

00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:24.400
I want to

00:24:26.110 --> 00:24:27.370
ask you for something.

00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:28.760
What do you want?

00:24:29.310 --> 00:24:31.240
I want Sinan's death certificate,

00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:32.310
his memorial photo,

00:24:32.310 --> 00:24:34.240
and the address of his burial site.

00:24:35.790 --> 00:24:37.160
Actually,

00:24:37.550 --> 00:24:39.920
I've been thinking about it
for a long time.

00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:40.960
Since I saw your return

00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:42.160
reported in the news,

00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:43.730
I've wanted to contact you.

00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:45.030
But I knew

00:24:45.030 --> 00:24:46.440
it wasn't the right time.

00:24:46.830 --> 00:24:47.750
You

00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:49.480
might not want to see me either.

00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:50.350
But

00:24:50.830 --> 00:24:52.630
now that everything's settled,

00:24:53.070 --> 00:24:55.030
I'm bold enough to come

00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:57.030
ask for these things.

00:24:57.750 --> 00:24:59.070
Why would you think

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:01.960
I'd give them to you?

00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:03.610
I'm not certain.

00:25:04.790 --> 00:25:06.070
So today, I've come

00:25:07.350 --> 00:25:08.750
to beg you.

00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:10.640
I know Sinan hurt you.

00:25:11.030 --> 00:25:11.920
Back then,

00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:13.550
he made the wrong choice,

00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:15.850
and it caused you tremendous pain.

00:25:16.590 --> 00:25:18.240
You've come a long way

00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:20.100
to get where you are today.

00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:21.400
So,

00:25:22.030 --> 00:25:23.750
it's understandable that you hate him.

00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:24.590
So what?

00:25:26.070 --> 00:25:27.720
Are you here to plead for him?

00:25:29.030 --> 00:25:30.440
I've hated him

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:33.040
for as long as he's been gone.

00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:35.410
I hate him not only for deceiving me

00:25:36.310 --> 00:25:37.710
but also for hurting you.

00:25:39.270 --> 00:25:41.000
Just one fleeting thought,

00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:42.800
and all that was peaceful

00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:44.640
and joyful

00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:47.510
was ruined.

00:25:48.750 --> 00:25:50.010
Are you saying all this

00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:52.240
to make me feel sorry for you?

00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:53.680
I want to tell you

00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:55.550
that in this world,

00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:57.160
there's someone else

00:26:00.310 --> 00:26:01.770
who suffers just like you.

00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:04.830
But

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.550
aside from resenting him,

00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:09.790
I don't understand either

00:26:09.790 --> 00:26:11.000
what Sinan's deeper motive was

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:11.720
for doing this

00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:13.350
in the first place.

00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:15.510
You know,

00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:16.960
his ties with the Lu family

00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:18.070
were terrible.

00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:20.590
When he was nine,

00:26:21.350 --> 00:26:23.080
his mother became gravely ill.

00:26:23.310 --> 00:26:24.000
His stepmother

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:25.830
moved in with her two children,

00:26:26.590 --> 00:26:27.590
and all he could do

00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:28.550
was watch helplessly

00:26:28.550 --> 00:26:30.440
as his mother suffered and died.

00:26:31.270 --> 00:26:33.110
Meanwhile,
his father and those two children

00:26:33.110 --> 00:26:34.570
lived happily as a family.

00:26:34.790 --> 00:26:36.440
He had no one but himself

00:26:37.270 --> 00:26:38.200
to rely on—

00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:39.860
You didn't come to apologize.

00:26:40.110 --> 00:26:41.970
So why are you telling me all this?

00:26:42.070 --> 00:26:43.800
No matter what he went through,

00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:46.270
it doesn't excuse the pain he caused me.

00:26:46.270 --> 00:26:47.720
He took Mare Nubium from me

00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:48.960
and ruined everything I had.

00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:50.640
Whatever reasons he had,

00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:53.310
I will never forgive him.

00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:54.240
Mm.

00:26:55.110 --> 00:26:55.910
I understand.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:58.160
I just

00:26:58.550 --> 00:27:00.160
wanted to share this information with you.

00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:01.690
If you don't want to hear it,

00:27:02.030 --> 00:27:03.090
then let's drop it.

00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:04.590
But...

00:27:06.350 --> 00:27:07.790
Could you please

00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:10.880
let me take him away?

00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:15.750
Take him away?

00:27:17.310 --> 00:27:17.790
Mm.

00:27:19.030 --> 00:27:20.430
Remove everything of his

00:27:21.030 --> 00:27:22.440
from this apartment

00:27:22.830 --> 00:27:24.070
and from your life,

00:27:24.590 --> 00:27:25.920
completely,

00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:28.520
without leaving a single trace.

00:27:28.830 --> 00:27:29.960
I'm so curious.

00:27:31.550 --> 00:27:32.810
Why are you doing this?

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:34.310
Because I love him.

00:27:35.750 --> 00:27:36.830
Even though

00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:38.550
he made

00:27:38.550 --> 00:27:39.830
a terrible mistake,

00:27:41.310 --> 00:27:42.550
I still love him.

00:27:43.270 --> 00:27:44.550
Even though

00:27:45.270 --> 00:27:47.440
he's been gone for four whole years,

00:27:48.830 --> 00:27:49.550
I still

00:27:49.550 --> 00:27:50.960
can't forget him.

00:27:52.350 --> 00:27:53.240
Ms. Ye,

00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:55.920
I know he made

00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:57.270
a terrible mistake.

00:27:58.200 --> 00:27:59.160
Now

00:27:59.590 --> 00:28:00.350
he has already paid

00:28:00.350 --> 00:28:01.480
with his life.

00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:04.480
Could you please

00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:06.810
let me see him one more time

00:28:08.310 --> 00:28:10.440
and take him away completely?

00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:12.830
You can pursue

00:28:12.830 --> 00:28:14.000
the life you want.

00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:15.510
You can also pursue

00:28:15.510 --> 00:28:16.970
the person you truly love.

00:28:19.790 --> 00:28:21.790
But my son and I have only him.

00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:27.550
Alright.

00:28:28.550 --> 00:28:30.000
His belongings and photos

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.200
will be organized

00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:32.750
and delivered to your address.

00:28:32.750 --> 00:28:33.960
The location of his burial

00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:34.510
will be sent

00:28:34.510 --> 00:28:35.680
to your phone.

00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:37.340
As for his death certificate,

00:28:38.590 --> 00:28:40.720
it's still
in the inheritance litigation process.

00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:41.920
When the process is complete,

00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:42.590
I'll have my lawyer

00:28:42.590 --> 00:28:43.640
deliver it to you.

00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:45.000
Ms. Ye,

00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:45.830
I...

00:28:45.830 --> 00:28:46.750
Take him away.

00:28:48.830 --> 00:28:49.920
Just like how

00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:51.960
he suddenly appeared

00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:52.880
in my life.

00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:55.270
Please

00:28:56.510 --> 00:28:57.750
take him away

00:28:58.440 --> 00:28:59.720
without leaving

00:29:00.550 --> 00:29:01.550
anything behind.

00:29:04.550 --> 00:29:05.790
I won't forgive him,

00:29:06.590 --> 00:29:08.050
but for the rest of my life,

00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:10.540
I don't want to think of him again.

00:29:16.590 --> 00:29:17.510
Ms. Ye,

00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:22.210
I'm sure
things will turn out well for you.

00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:24.070
You will definitely meet

00:29:24.070 --> 00:29:25.670
someone who truly loves you.

00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:27.840
You definitely will.

00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:53.680
Haimeng!

00:29:54.590 --> 00:29:55.310
Haimeng!

00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:01.680
Haimeng.

00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:04.060
I'm so glad you're still home.

00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:04.790
I've been running

00:30:04.790 --> 00:30:06.250
back and forth for an hour.

00:30:06.310 --> 00:30:06.920
Finally made it

00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:08.550
to bring them to you.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:09.830
These are from Siyu.

00:30:09.830 --> 00:30:10.830
He asked me

00:30:10.830 --> 00:30:12.690
to give them to you before he left.

00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:14.180
I don't know what they are.

00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:15.300
Your earrings?

00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:17.750
Anyway,

00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:18.350
he insisted that I

00:30:18.350 --> 00:30:19.790
give them to you personally.

00:30:19.790 --> 00:30:21.000
He also wanted me to tell you

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:22.680
that these are your very own

00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:23.680
wishing stars.

00:30:25.590 --> 00:30:26.550
Wait,

00:30:27.030 --> 00:30:28.160
so instead of four-leaf clovers,

00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:29.350
they're using diamonds

00:30:29.350 --> 00:30:30.480
to make wishes now?

00:30:32.550 --> 00:30:33.240
Haimeng.

00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:34.350
Haimeng!

00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:36.400
Don't you want these?

00:30:38.110 --> 00:30:38.830
Haimeng.

Siyu

00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:46.110
asked me to deliver something to Haimeng.

00:32:46.110 --> 00:32:46.720
I've already

00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:47.680
delivered it.

But,

00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:50.580
Haimeng refuses to accept it.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:52.590
What should I do

00:32:52.590 --> 00:32:53.880
with these earrings?

00:32:56.160 --> 00:32:57.160
I'll take the earrings.

00:32:57.160 --> 00:32:57.820

00:33:02.590 --> 00:33:04.750
Siyu has already gone to the airport.

00:33:06.310 --> 00:33:08.200
There's still about
