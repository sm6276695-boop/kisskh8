Wan Guchen!

00:06:30.339 --> 00:06:30.860
Yixi,

00:06:31.819 --> 00:06:33.060
I have good news.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.240
I'm now Nine Heavens' Sword Master.

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:40.879
You did it.

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:43.699
From now on, I'll guard your seal.

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:45.839
Then I can convince them to release you.

00:06:53.399 --> 00:06:55.000
I have a gift for you.

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:58.379
My mother

00:06:59.779 --> 00:07:01.459
left a jade pendant for my beloved.

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:03.959
But it's in Wanfeng Kingdom.

00:07:04.959 --> 00:07:06.120
Wait while I retrieve it.

00:07:08.339 --> 00:07:08.699
Okay.

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:10.779
I'll wait.

00:07:11.699 --> 00:07:12.579
I'll return soon.

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:28.600
Wan Guchen!

00:07:29.319 --> 00:07:30.959
How dare you enter the hall armed?

00:07:31.319 --> 00:07:32.600
You're truly treasonous!

00:07:40.339 --> 00:07:42.139
As the crown prince, my father

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:44.079
was killed by the Night Clan.

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:47.420
You uncles and elders

00:07:47.519 --> 00:07:49.120
feared my inheritance of the throne.

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:51.920
So you fabricated rumors
about my ill omens.

00:07:53.959 --> 00:07:56.839
For years, my grandfather has refused
to reinstall the crown prince.

00:08:00.379 --> 00:08:02.019
So you've always feared me

00:08:03.879 --> 00:08:04.839
and framed me.

00:08:05.959 --> 00:08:07.680
Now I'm the immortal sects'
Sword Master.

00:08:08.459 --> 00:08:10.699
I came only
to retrieve my parents' heirloom

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:13.120
for my beloved.

00:08:14.939 --> 00:08:16.139
If anyone obstructs me again,

00:08:17.459 --> 00:08:19.579
I won't hold back.

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:21.740
Understood.

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:23.319
Understood.

00:08:39.179 --> 00:08:39.820
War God,

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:41.399
the Immortal Lord awaits you

00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:42.460
for important matters.

00:08:44.139 --> 00:08:44.700
I see.

00:08:50.399 --> 00:08:51.399
Wan Guchen,

00:08:51.799 --> 00:08:52.960
you're finally back.

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:56.200
Immortal Lord,

00:08:56.679 --> 00:08:58.639
Wan Guchen abused
his new Sword Master position

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:00.519
to descend to Wanfeng Kingdom

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:02.200
and cause chaos with immortal arts.

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:04.480
It violates the divine laws.

00:09:11.399 --> 00:09:12.759
Is this true?

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:13.919
No.

00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:17.299
I merely went to the Mortal Realm
to retrieve my parents' keepsake

00:09:17.759 --> 00:09:19.360
to gift it to my beloved.

00:09:19.779 --> 00:09:20.059
You...

00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:23.500
Are you going to see Bai Yixi?

00:09:23.899 --> 00:09:24.379
Exactly.

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:28.000
Then I can't allow your meeting.

00:09:29.659 --> 00:09:30.220
Why?

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:34.559
Because Bai Yixi is the Night Deity.

00:09:35.059 --> 00:09:37.220
She's the malevolence
the Three Realms must eradicate.

00:09:37.919 --> 00:09:39.480
No one can visit her.

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:40.240
This is an order.

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:41.399
Those who defy it

00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:43.600
will be deemed traitors
to the immortal sects.

00:09:45.059 --> 00:09:45.740
What do you mean?

00:09:46.795 --> 00:09:48.035
You said being the Sword Master

00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:50.050
was to safeguard the Night Deity's seal.

00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:52.019
Why can't I see her?

00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:54.740
Was I not explicit enough?

00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:58.100
The Sword Master's duty
isn't merely safeguarding the seal.

00:09:58.419 --> 00:10:02.019
Your true mission is to kill Bai Yixi,
who contains the Night Deity.

00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:05.139
Only this will completely eliminate
the Night Deity.

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:11.980
What do you mean?

00:10:12.679 --> 00:10:13.840
Have you been deceiving us?

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:16.960
Originally, as the Sword Master,
I should have

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:18.559
personally executed her back then.

00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:21.059
But my fierce battle
with the Night Deity

00:10:21.059 --> 00:10:22.220
left me gravely injured.

00:10:22.259 --> 00:10:24.899
And my diminished cultivation
made the Divine Sword reject me.

00:10:25.379 --> 00:10:29.220
So I needed a new Sword Master
to fulfill heaven's decree.

00:10:30.139 --> 00:10:32.620
Now the seal on her weakens daily.

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:34.720
I fear the day

00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:37.899
the Night Deity
breaks free from the sealing.

00:10:38.559 --> 00:10:39.879
Then why did you tell me

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:41.300
being the Sword Master

00:10:41.545 --> 00:10:43.065
meant guarding the Night Deity's seal?

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:46.960
Because she's
the Divine Maiden's daughter.

00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:53.740
I couldn't bear revealing
to the immortal sects

00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:56.419
that the target of our execution

00:10:57.100 --> 00:10:58.899
is the Divine Maiden's child.

00:10:59.259 --> 00:11:00.379
But for her,

00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:02.779
isn't it unbearable injustice?

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:06.179
Shall we let the Night Deity break free
and cast the world into chaos,

00:11:06.179 --> 00:11:07.620
making us eternal sinners,

00:11:07.919 --> 00:11:09.039
or eradicate the Night Deity

00:11:09.159 --> 00:11:10.480
for everyone's sake?

00:11:10.639 --> 00:11:12.279
Do we truly have a choice?

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:22.200
No.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:23.840
I promised her

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:24.720
I'd see her.

00:11:25.279 --> 00:11:26.879
Or she'll be worried and scared.

00:11:28.799 --> 00:11:29.559
After seeing her,

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:32.080
I'll accept any punishment demanded.

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:33.480
Immortals, form the array!

00:11:40.059 --> 00:11:43.019
Sword Master, reflect on your actions.

00:12:39.899 --> 00:12:42.220
The Immortal Lord instructed me
to deliver this.

00:12:48.899 --> 00:12:49.820
Where's Wan Guchen?

00:12:50.539 --> 00:12:52.620
He was executed
for defying the Immortal Lord.

00:12:53.059 --> 00:12:54.620
He held this jade pendant when he died.

00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:03.159
It can't be.

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:06.759
It can't be!

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:09.840
You're lying, aren't you?

00:13:20.139 --> 00:13:21.340
He's such a good man.

00:13:23.779 --> 00:13:25.299
Why would you treat him like this?

00:13:26.019 --> 00:13:27.220
Tell me this is a lie!

00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:29.100
You must be lying!

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:30.539
It's all your fault.

00:13:31.019 --> 00:13:32.899
Anyway, anyone involved with you

00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:34.139
couldn't possibly be good.

00:13:34.779 --> 00:13:36.620
He was never worthy
of being Sword Master.

00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:38.100
He deserved that lightning strike.

00:13:39.019 --> 00:13:39.539
No!

00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:40.779
You're lying!

00:13:41.539 --> 00:13:42.539
It can't be!

00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:44.779
It can't be.

00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:47.620
(What a despicable lackey.)

00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:53.299
Who's there?

00:13:56.019 --> 00:13:57.500
(Years of endurance)

00:13:58.139 --> 00:14:00.940
(only brought news
of your beloved's death.)

00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:04.659
(Will you keep enduring this?)

00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:22.500
Since you killed Chen,

00:14:23.899 --> 00:14:25.659
prepare to join him in death!

00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:52.360
Night Deity,

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:54.559
it's been too long.

00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:57.039
Indeed it has,

00:14:57.639 --> 00:14:59.159
Immortal Changgeng.

00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:03.320
Every torment this vessel endured

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:05.159
remains etched in my memory.

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:09.519
Had the Nine Heavens not pushed so hard,

00:15:10.679 --> 00:15:12.799
I might not have awakened so soon.

00:15:14.679 --> 00:15:16.919
Now that you've killed Wan Guchen,

00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:20.440
I'll return the favor by killing you

00:15:21.799 --> 00:15:25.080
as fulfilling this girl's wish.

00:15:26.139 --> 00:15:26.820
Bai Yixi!

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:29.179
Wan Guchen isn't dead.

00:15:30.679 --> 00:15:31.519
What?

00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:32.519
Yixi!

00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:49.248
The Immortal Lord
injured me unwillingly.

00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:50.850
He let an Upper Immortal treat me.

00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:53.220
My injuries prevented me
from meeting you.

00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:56.580
So I asked them to deliver the pendant.

00:15:58.580 --> 00:15:59.379
Wan Guchen.

00:16:05.019 --> 00:16:06.659
Changgeng, you lied to me!

00:16:07.019 --> 00:16:07.700
Wan Guchen,

00:16:08.139 --> 00:16:09.019
you see it now.

00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:11.860
You can see what Bai Yixi
is destined to become.

00:16:12.379 --> 00:16:14.940
Imagine the devastation she'll cause!

00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:18.620
Kill her.

00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:20.500
Kill her now!

00:16:20.919 --> 00:16:22.000
Only by killing her

00:16:22.250 --> 00:16:24.648
can the Night Deity be stopped
from harming the Three Realms.

00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:27.100
Wan Guchen!

00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:32.960
Wan Guchen,

00:16:33.799 --> 00:16:35.519
don't you remember our promise?

00:16:42.259 --> 00:16:43.220
Why are you waiting?

00:16:43.539 --> 00:16:44.720
Once he breaks the seal

00:16:44.899 --> 00:16:46.879
and completely takes over
Bai Yixi's body,

00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:49.220
there'll be no way
to bring Bai Yixi back.

00:16:52.139 --> 00:16:53.059
Do it!

00:16:53.940 --> 00:16:54.980
Do it now!

00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:23.180
Chen,

00:17:26.339 --> 00:17:28.420
I don't want the Night Deity
to steal my body.

00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:30.460
I beg you.

00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:32.500
Please help me!

00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:35.140
Please...

00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:00.119
No.

00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:09.220
Wan Guchen,

00:18:09.619 --> 00:18:11.259
do you have any idea what you're doing?

00:18:11.779 --> 00:18:13.380
Your lingering ties with the Night Deity

00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:15.539
will bring endless calamity.

00:18:27.779 --> 00:18:28.900
I'll take Yixi away.

00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:31.900
So she can never harm anyone.

00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:33.500
You...

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:47.800
The Divine Sword is sealed.

00:18:48.779 --> 00:18:49.660
Starting today,

00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:52.740
I'll leave the Nine Heavens with you.

00:18:57.819 --> 00:18:59.059
Where else can we go?

00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:03.839
I'm terrified
the Night Deity might reappear.

00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:07.980
Don't overthink it.

00:19:10.059 --> 00:19:10.900
I'll accompany you

00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:12.519
wherever you want to go.

00:19:15.259 --> 00:19:16.339
I'll always stay with you.

00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:19.380
Then

00:19:21.099 --> 00:19:23.440
I want to visit
where you lived as a child.

00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:26.579
Okay.

00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:27.839
I'll show you.

00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:29.140
Okay.

00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:37.259
Is this your hometown?

00:19:38.770 --> 00:19:40.370
It's my first visit to the Mortal Realm.

00:19:40.819 --> 00:19:41.579
Do you like it?

00:19:46.299 --> 00:19:46.819
Miss,

00:19:48.339 --> 00:19:49.259
buy a flower wreath?

00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:56.680
What is this flower?

00:19:57.500 --> 00:19:58.299
It's beautiful.

00:19:59.259 --> 00:20:00.380
I've never seen it before.

00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:04.079
It's the Knotgrass Flower.

00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:05.740
A wreath of knots

00:20:07.299 --> 00:20:08.059
all for one.

00:20:12.619 --> 00:20:14.019
With this wreath,

00:20:14.019 --> 00:20:15.380
you look like an immortal lady.

00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:16.339
Truly breathtaking.

00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:17.400
It's yours.

00:20:17.599 --> 00:20:18.160
No charge.

00:20:21.059 --> 00:20:23.019
If there's someone in this world
who's all for me,

00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:24.680
then my life journey

00:20:25.599 --> 00:20:26.640
is never in vain.

00:20:33.119 --> 00:20:33.799
Look.

00:20:37.850 --> 00:20:39.650
They say if you write wishes
on a sky lantern,

00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:41.079
they'll come true.

00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:44.599
They're beautiful.

00:20:45.799 --> 00:20:46.240
Let's go.

00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:47.400
I'll show you.

00:20:50.048 --> 00:20:52.608
(I want to build a home
with Wan Guchen.)

00:20:53.519 --> 00:20:53.920
Done.

00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:55.260
What did you write?

00:20:57.680 --> 00:20:58.400
I won't tell you.

00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:02.000
Make a wish first

00:21:02.839 --> 00:21:03.640
with eyes closed.

00:21:14.368 --> 00:21:16.352
(I want to build a home
with Wan Guchen.)

00:21:30.619 --> 00:21:31.299
Ready?

00:21:32.059 --> 00:21:32.500
Yes.

00:21:34.220 --> 00:21:34.619
Come on.

00:21:42.019 --> 00:21:42.500
Three.

00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:44.700
Two.

00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:46.660
One.

00:22:03.619 --> 00:22:04.980
What wish did you make?

00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:09.680
May Bai Yixi

00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:12.119
be safe

00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:13.799
and happy.

00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:20.759
Do you think

00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:24.819
those old fogies in the Nine Heavens
will grant our wishes

00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:27.200
when seeing our lantern?

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:29.839
Had I known,

00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:32.819
I'd have written, "Nine Heavens, scram"!

00:22:51.072 --> 00:23:01.312
(Falling Snow)

00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:05.819
Mountains lie to the west

00:23:06.095 --> 00:23:07.295
and the market's to the north.

00:23:08.579 --> 00:23:09.660
I've bought this place.

00:23:11.059 --> 00:23:12.420
From now on, it'll be our home.

00:23:19.819 --> 00:23:20.460
Thank you.

00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:25.640
I love it here.

(Falling Snow)

00:25:02.140 --> 00:25:02.660
Yixi,

00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:04.250
it's Wanfeng Kingdom's famed dish...

00:25:09.359 --> 00:25:09.960
Yixi?

00:25:16.319 --> 00:25:16.920
Yixi!

00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:32.240
Yixi?

00:25:42.619 --> 00:25:43.259
Yixi.

00:25:44.299 --> 00:25:44.779
Yixi!

00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:45.839
It's me, Chen.

00:25:46.359 --> 00:25:46.799
Yixi,

00:25:47.759 --> 00:25:49.039
resist the Night Deity.

00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:49.839
Yixi!

00:25:58.500 --> 00:25:59.259
If this

00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:01.599
can ease your suffering,

00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:03.339
I'll endure

00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:05.019
however much you take.

00:26:13.019 --> 00:26:13.619
Yixi,

00:26:15.359 --> 00:26:16.700
no matter how you change,

00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:19.619
I'll always recognize you.

00:26:21.019 --> 00:26:21.980
Because I know

00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:25.480
you'd never harm me.

00:26:32.119 --> 00:26:32.759
Yixi!

00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:53.099
What's wrong?

00:26:53.740 --> 00:26:54.299
Nightmare?

00:26:57.420 --> 00:26:57.980
I'm fine.

00:26:59.059 --> 00:27:00.180
But I feel

00:27:00.819 --> 00:27:02.980
the Night Deity's power within me
is harder to control.

00:27:03.579 --> 00:27:05.500
I don't know when it'll break free

00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:06.980
and hurt you again.

00:27:08.579 --> 00:27:09.220
Chen,

00:27:10.819 --> 00:27:11.940
I'm so scared.

00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:15.059
I'm scared I'll be fully consumed by it

00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:17.019
and lose my mind.

00:27:18.059 --> 00:27:20.619
Then I might forget everything
between us.

00:27:20.619 --> 00:27:21.019
Never.

00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:23.539
With me here,

00:27:24.940 --> 00:27:26.500
you won't face all this alone.

00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:30.900
I'll prepare some calming herbs.

00:27:31.940 --> 00:27:32.460
Fear not.

00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:34.740
We'll get through this.

00:27:53.888 --> 00:27:55.119
Yes. It's him!

00:27:56.380 --> 00:27:56.780
Back then,

00:27:57.019 --> 00:27:58.259
I saw that woman

00:27:58.579 --> 00:27:59.168
was like...

00:28:01.539 --> 00:28:02.900
"It hurts so much."

00:28:03.319 --> 00:28:05.279
"Let me bite you."

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:09.720
The Night Deity

00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:11.799
drained his life force back then.

00:28:12.079 --> 00:28:13.200
I saw it with my own eyes.

00:28:13.279 --> 00:28:14.440
No doubt about it!

00:28:14.599 --> 00:28:15.440
Wan Guchen,

00:28:16.319 --> 00:28:19.319
how dare you bring Bai Yixi,
that demon, to Wanfeng Kingdom!

00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:22.799
You're risking all the kingdom's lives.

00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:24.920
You truly are a curse!

00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:26.359
Exactly! A monster!

00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:27.000
A curse!

00:28:27.599 --> 00:28:28.079
Right!

00:28:28.559 --> 00:28:29.559
You knew you were cursed,

00:28:29.839 --> 00:28:30.599
yet came back!

00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:31.559
And you even

00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:32.599
brought a devil with you.

00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:34.480
It was deliberate!

00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:36.440
How could the royal family
produce such filth!

00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:37.759
Pure evil!

00:28:38.359 --> 00:28:40.640
The Night Deity kills mercilessly.

00:28:40.799 --> 00:28:42.400
One glance at her

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:44.359
and you're dead by dawn.

00:28:44.799 --> 00:28:45.920
What should we do?

00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:50.940
She's possessed by the Night Deity.

00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:52.700
She's innocent.

00:28:54.599 --> 00:28:56.819
If she knows the Night Deity
is sealed within her,

00:28:57.099 --> 00:28:58.380
she shouldn't have wandered.

00:28:59.420 --> 00:29:01.660
Those she killed were truly innocent.

00:29:01.660 --> 00:29:02.180
Exactly!

00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:02.740
Well said!

00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:05.339
Irresponsible!

00:29:06.740 --> 00:29:07.460
Enough talk.

00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:08.740
Arrest him

00:29:09.339 --> 00:29:10.859
and then seize Bai Yixi.

00:29:11.539 --> 00:29:12.180
Get them!

00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:22.279
Xiaochuan!

00:29:22.900 --> 00:29:23.779
Don't hurt him!

00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:29.039
Xiaochuan!

00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:33.440
Mother, I don't think he's evil.

00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:36.240
Having a demon sealed inside is sad.

00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:38.519
You won't kill anyone, right?

00:29:40.359 --> 00:29:41.160
I promise

00:29:42.079 --> 00:29:43.200
we won't kill.

00:29:48.660 --> 00:29:49.099
Xiaochuan!

00:29:50.039 --> 00:29:50.720
Where is he?

00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:53.680
Useless fools!

00:30:05.839 --> 00:30:06.480
Yixi!

00:30:07.220 --> 00:30:07.660
Yixi!

00:30:11.339 --> 00:30:11.819
Yixi!

00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:13.940
Yixi, what's wrong?

00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:16.360
Is the demonic energy flaring up?

00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:17.900
Yixi.

00:30:18.976 --> 00:30:20.299
Don't shut me out. Let me in.

00:30:20.299 --> 00:30:20.980
I can help you!

00:30:22.259 --> 00:30:22.819
Yixi!
