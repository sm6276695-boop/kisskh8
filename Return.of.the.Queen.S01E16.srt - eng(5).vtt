Although this contract appears

to be unsigned,

00:17:35.070 --> 00:17:36.270
the files contain

to pull the financial reports
from that year,

00:20:04.590 --> 00:20:05.880
Have you forgotten

00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:06.830
how the Lu family treated you?

00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:08.030
Of course I remember.

00:20:08.350 --> 00:20:09.200
But does that mean I should be

00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:10.240
trapped in the Lu family forever?

00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:11.440
But isn't being with Lu Siyu

00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:12.200
just the same as going back
to the Lu family?

00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:13.510
Lu Siyu is Lu Siyu.

00:20:13.510 --> 00:20:14.830
He's different from Lu Sinan.

00:20:14.830 --> 00:20:15.640
How is he different?

00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:16.240
Isn't he Lu Sinan's

00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:17.110
biological brother?

00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:17.920
Don't they have

00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:19.000
the same father?

00:20:22.550 --> 00:20:23.510
Haimeng, I'm begging you,

00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:25.030
don't delude yourself

00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:26.070
into thinking

00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:28.110
that Lu Siyu is different from Lu Sinan.

00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:29.110
They're the same.

00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:30.550
They're both from the Lu family.

00:20:30.550 --> 00:20:32.030
They're both sons of the Lu family.

00:20:32.030 --> 00:20:32.640
They share

00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:33.240

00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:34.830

00:20:49.310 --> 00:20:51.170
that I was once married to Lu Sinan

00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:52.200
or that I was once the eldest
daughter-in-law of the Lu family,

00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:52.960
using those things

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:53.720
against me.

what relationship I have
with the Lu family.

I also don't care about

00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:02.750
what kind of relationship
I once had with Lu Siyu,

00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:04.610
nor do I care about that he and I...

00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:05.270
I have the right

00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:06.480
to decide what I want to do.

00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:07.510
As for what you said—

00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:09.040
that he's just like Lu Sinan

00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:11.370
and that they're both from the Lu family—

00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:12.750
Siyu is different.

00:21:13.030 --> 00:21:13.830

by his family.

00:21:15.310 --> 00:21:16.160
He's never learned

00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:17.400
those underhanded tactics.

00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:18.510

clean and honest.

00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:22.200
And I believe

00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:23.680
he will continue to

00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:24.550
walk his path

00:21:24.550 --> 00:21:27.150

and integrity.

sweet talk

00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:51.110

I was working,

00:28:10.310 --> 00:28:11.070
and one phone call from you

00:28:11.070 --> 00:28:12.640
made me, the president, skip work.

00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:14.480
Even a president isn't a work machine.

00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:16.480

00:28:45.310 --> 00:28:46.960
You really underestimate me.

00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:48.000
I've lived abroad for over a decade.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:49.000
If I couldn't drive,

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:50.860
I wouldn't be able to go anywhere.

00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:51.550
