00:00:19.102 --> 00:00:20.354
My name is Kang Hanna.

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:24.691
I've always wanted to meet you.

00:00:25.317 --> 00:00:28.320
It's insulting that you don't know me,
but I know you.

00:00:28.403 --> 00:00:30.781
It just doesn't seem right, if you ask me.

00:00:35.077 --> 00:00:36.578
How old is your son now?

00:00:39.957 --> 00:00:42.000
So, you wanna know when it started?

00:00:44.211 --> 00:00:45.462
He's nine years old.

00:00:47.923 --> 00:00:51.260
Junik's mother says
my boy's just like Junik at that age.

00:00:58.976 --> 00:01:00.269
Wanna play LEGOs with me?

00:01:08.902 --> 00:01:11.822
He loves to draw
and he's very good at singing.

00:01:12.906 --> 00:01:16.285
He always looked forward to
playing soccer with his dad on weekends.

00:01:16.785 --> 00:01:19.413
Even though he only ever saw him
once or twice a week,

00:01:19.496 --> 00:01:21.164
he loved him
more than anyone in the world.

00:01:22.916 --> 00:01:26.628
But instead of playing with his dad,
now he's in play therapy,

00:01:26.712 --> 00:01:30.674
because his dad was murdered.

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.511
Happened at the church
while he sang in the choir.

00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:39.641
He saw the whole thing.

00:01:42.894 --> 00:01:44.563
Your son saw it happen?

00:01:45.147 --> 00:01:48.275
Eunseong sings
in the Little Tree Boys Choir.

00:01:58.827 --> 00:02:00.245
MASS FOR PEACE

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.748
ENTRANCE HYMN
THE LITTLE TREE BOYS CHOIR

00:02:04.791 --> 00:02:05.917
What's wrong?

00:02:07.794 --> 00:02:09.087
Nothing.

00:02:09.171 --> 00:02:10.672
Every day, I wonder,

00:02:12.007 --> 00:02:16.136
would I still hate you as much as I do

00:02:18.055 --> 00:02:20.265
if my son hadn't watched it happen?

00:02:21.975 --> 00:02:26.229
Since that day, your grief and misery's
been seen across the nation.

00:02:27.397 --> 00:02:30.817
You handle your grief so gracefully.

00:02:43.246 --> 00:02:45.040
You look beautiful in profile.

00:02:45.832 --> 00:02:49.878
This picture of you,
in particular, is heartbreaking.

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:56.802
How is it that you held back the tears
in your eyes for so long?

00:02:57.803 --> 00:03:01.181
Everyone says that you're able to grieve
with such grace and dignity,

00:03:01.765 --> 00:03:05.727
but I was clutching my chest
and wailing when it happened.

00:03:19.408 --> 00:03:21.910
While they marveled
at your composed grief,

00:03:22.411 --> 00:03:24.621
- I was running around like a madwoman…
- Junik!

00:03:24.705 --> 00:03:26.415
- Honey!
- …trying to protect my child alone.

00:03:26.498 --> 00:03:30.460
{\an8}The very tragic death of my
husband, Jang Junik, who fought for peace…

00:03:30.544 --> 00:03:32.212
And while you were
telling the world

00:03:32.295 --> 00:03:34.005
you'd carry on your husband's legacy,

00:03:34.089 --> 00:03:36.425
…when I was almost killed
on that train,

00:03:36.508 --> 00:03:39.428
the whole time I was running
toward this moment.

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:44.558
I was so devastated

00:03:44.641 --> 00:03:47.352
I couldn't even bring myself
to touch the jacket he left.

00:03:54.776 --> 00:03:55.819
What do you want?

00:03:59.865 --> 00:04:02.033
I got the DNA test results.

00:04:02.117 --> 00:04:04.911
I'll be filing a paternity lawsuit soon.

00:04:04.995 --> 00:04:06.413
I'll tell everyone who will listen

00:04:06.496 --> 00:04:09.166
that Jang Junik's secret son is

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.169
claiming everything
that was taken from him.

00:04:15.505 --> 00:04:16.965
Oh,

00:04:17.048 --> 00:04:19.634
and Junik's grandmother's backing us
in the lawsuit.

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:23.221
She's the one who suggested
that we move in with them

00:04:23.305 --> 00:04:25.724
to show everyone
we have the family's full support.

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.272
Tomorrow, we're moving into the house
Junik used to live in.

00:04:35.942 --> 00:04:37.277
This all falls on Junik.

00:04:38.361 --> 00:04:40.197
He should've asked me for a divorce.

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.034
He could be selfish like that sometimes.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.914
I can give your son more
than he's entitled.

00:04:48.997 --> 00:04:52.125
Let's keep this all quiet.
It'll be better for him that way.

00:04:52.209 --> 00:04:53.752
That much I know for certain.

00:04:53.835 --> 00:04:58.757
It's just like
what Junik told me.

00:04:59.257 --> 00:05:00.592
Nothing gets to you.

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:03.887
Though, unlike you, I have zero patience.

00:05:04.429 --> 00:05:09.142
The reason why I tolerated it all
was because I loved him.

00:05:09.226 --> 00:05:11.311
You think I'm doing this for the money?

00:05:11.394 --> 00:05:12.979
I want to blow this up,

00:05:13.063 --> 00:05:15.273
make sure the whole entire world knows

00:05:15.357 --> 00:05:17.776
that I was the one Junik really loved,

00:05:18.276 --> 00:05:19.444
that I had his child,

00:05:20.195 --> 00:05:21.947
and that your grief is all just a show.

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:25.617
There's no such thing
as graceful grief.

00:05:33.792 --> 00:05:36.086
Real grief will always be graceless.

00:05:37.671 --> 00:05:40.340
It makes you scream and thrash
like a wild animal.

00:05:46.304 --> 00:05:47.389
Where's that?

00:05:49.683 --> 00:05:51.768
Malmö, Sweden in 2022,

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:53.687
when I was six.

00:05:54.354 --> 00:05:55.397
Looks great.

00:05:56.523 --> 00:05:57.607
D'you want it?

00:06:00.652 --> 00:06:01.653
Well, thank you.

00:06:02.237 --> 00:06:03.572
I have a lot more.

00:06:05.031 --> 00:06:06.575
I've traveled around a lot.

00:06:13.415 --> 00:06:15.750
This must be your first time
losing someone you love.

00:06:18.879 --> 00:06:20.005
This is my third.

00:06:22.382 --> 00:06:24.092
Grieving takes a lot of energy.

00:06:25.552 --> 00:06:28.722
It starts with anger, then humiliation,

00:06:29.347 --> 00:06:32.809
then resentment, regret, and guilt.

00:06:33.935 --> 00:06:37.147
And once you've gone through all those
emotions, the real grief sets in.

00:06:38.106 --> 00:06:39.190
The real grief

00:06:40.066 --> 00:06:43.069
is terribly quiet
and as heavy as a ton of bricks.

00:06:44.654 --> 00:06:47.282
So don't wear yourself out quite yet.

00:06:47.365 --> 00:06:49.451
You need to be able to take care
of your child.

00:06:49.534 --> 00:06:51.411
Junik was completely miserable!

00:06:51.911 --> 00:06:52.954
All because of you.

00:06:55.206 --> 00:06:56.541
You never loved him, did you?

00:06:57.792 --> 00:06:59.502
When was the last time you slept together?

00:07:04.466 --> 00:07:05.467
You know,

00:07:06.468 --> 00:07:10.889
I wanted to save the man I love
from his awful marriage.

00:07:11.556 --> 00:07:15.143
Junik was the one drowning,
clutching a rock as he sank!

00:07:24.361 --> 00:07:26.321
Typically, I don't fight the weak,

00:07:27.614 --> 00:07:29.783
but if I have to, I won't back down.

00:07:31.451 --> 00:07:33.495
Pull yourself together, Miss Kang Hanna.

00:07:35.163 --> 00:07:37.666
Even after you make it through
something this terrible…

00:07:39.626 --> 00:07:41.795
there's never a guarantee
it won't happen again.

00:07:57.894 --> 00:08:00.730
Did you know that I designed
this necklace you're wearing?

00:08:03.316 --> 00:08:06.986
It's the most popular design
for the past 2,000 years.

00:08:08.738 --> 00:08:10.824
Apparently,
it's been the most popular design

00:08:10.907 --> 00:08:12.951
for the past 2,000 years.

00:08:13.034 --> 00:08:14.994
I'm a jewelry designer.

00:08:15.829 --> 00:08:18.206
Do you know what I prayed for
while I was making this?

00:08:18.873 --> 00:08:23.503
That you would be able to feel
the same horrible pain that I do.

00:08:24.754 --> 00:08:27.507
God answers prayers in mysterious ways.

00:08:31.761 --> 00:08:33.054
You think I'm not a threat.

00:08:34.931 --> 00:08:37.267
But I'll do whatever it takes
to make you cry.

00:08:38.518 --> 00:08:43.481
I promise you, I will see those tears
as they fall to the ground.

00:09:02.083 --> 00:09:03.084
Ms. Seo.

00:09:03.835 --> 00:09:04.836
I'm okay.

00:09:40.121 --> 00:09:43.416
TEMPEST

00:10:00.809 --> 00:10:01.976
How long have you known?

00:10:06.189 --> 00:10:07.857
Guess she found a way
to meet you after all.

00:10:07.941 --> 00:10:10.944
Tell me how long you've been
making a fool of me, Mother!

00:10:11.027 --> 00:10:12.487
She's an expert.

00:10:13.071 --> 00:10:15.740
She deliberately went after Junik
and used him.

00:10:15.824 --> 00:10:17.826
I had everything handled
before the election.

00:10:17.909 --> 00:10:21.371
I offered her a good amount of money,
and she agreed to move abroad.

00:10:21.454 --> 00:10:22.539
It's infuriating.

00:10:23.373 --> 00:10:25.458
And now, I've lost my chance forever.

00:10:25.542 --> 00:10:28.336
The chance to go up to Junik
and finally tell him I'm leaving.

00:10:29.337 --> 00:10:32.340
I'd bring him back just to divorce him
if I could!

00:10:36.886 --> 00:10:37.887
I know.

00:10:39.055 --> 00:10:41.641
It feels like you're tail-spinning
into nothingness.

00:10:44.269 --> 00:10:45.436
But you know what?

00:10:46.354 --> 00:10:47.730
This won't kill you.

00:10:50.108 --> 00:10:52.527
Right now, it feels like your world
has turned upside down.

00:10:53.236 --> 00:10:56.698
But by tomorrow morning,
you'll wake up and see it isn't so bad.

00:10:59.617 --> 00:11:00.702
And then one day,

00:11:01.953 --> 00:11:03.955
you'll realize that it made you stronger.

00:11:05.165 --> 00:11:07.792
I should know.
I've been through it many times.

00:11:09.377 --> 00:11:11.296
Why did you tell me to run for president?

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:14.591
To humiliate me in front of everyone?

00:11:14.674 --> 00:11:16.092
You knew, didn't you?

00:11:16.176 --> 00:11:18.052
That the mistress was gonna come forward.

00:11:21.639 --> 00:11:23.391
This is an opportunity for you.

00:11:24.267 --> 00:11:25.268
Don't you see that?

00:11:25.935 --> 00:11:29.522
A chance to step out of Junik's shadow
and run as your own person.

00:11:29.606 --> 00:11:32.901
To show your vulnerability
and let people embrace you for it.

00:11:34.277 --> 00:11:36.112
A chance to prove she can't break you,

00:11:36.779 --> 00:11:42.285
and to show everyone you'll move
past this, no matter what the problem is.

00:11:49.334 --> 00:11:51.878
Sometimes, you sound absolutely deranged.

00:11:54.422 --> 00:11:55.757
From this moment on,

00:11:57.091 --> 00:11:58.801
I'm cutting all ties with you.

00:12:02.347 --> 00:12:04.182
You can't become president without me.

00:12:08.269 --> 00:12:10.605
This is not how I want
to win the election.

00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:20.782
{\an8}"…SHALL BE OWNED BY LIM OKSEON"

00:12:21.824 --> 00:12:24.869
That's right. I'm rescinding our contract.

00:12:28.039 --> 00:12:29.832
You really think
you can get away with this?

00:12:31.376 --> 00:12:34.629
When I left this place, there was
only one thing I made sure to take.

00:12:36.422 --> 00:12:38.007
The jewelry box you gave me.

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:40.468
You remember?

00:12:44.806 --> 00:12:47.934
Fill this up with gifts from Junik
from over the years.

00:12:48.893 --> 00:12:50.603
It will bring you happiness.

00:12:59.570 --> 00:13:02.240
Mother, this is tax evasion.

00:13:03.616 --> 00:13:07.120
What are you talking about?
This is a perfectly legal tax deduction.

00:13:09.122 --> 00:13:11.457
I didn't think
jewelry would make me happy.

00:13:11.541 --> 00:13:13.418
So instead,
I started collecting your secrets.

00:13:13.501 --> 00:13:14.752
What's the matter with you?

00:13:14.836 --> 00:13:17.297
Ever since you married that girl,
you've been acting strange!

00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:19.632
She has nothing to do with this,
so don't blame her.

00:13:20.174 --> 00:13:22.552
I refuse to be a part
of any kind of tax fraud.

00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:26.931
Because I thought
they could protect me one day.

00:13:27.807 --> 00:13:29.392
2007 1ST QUARTER

00:13:29.475 --> 00:13:32.020
FINANCIAL STATEMENT
ACCOUNTING FRAUD

00:13:32.603 --> 00:13:34.564
Thanks to my collection,
I could work with you,

00:13:34.647 --> 00:13:37.108
despite knowing exactly
what kind of person you are.

00:13:44.657 --> 00:13:48.244
So now, make sure that woman stays quiet.

00:13:49.746 --> 00:13:53.833
I'd better not hear anything
about her ever again.

00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:01.549
You never had the decency
to come visit me, so here I am.

00:14:03.551 --> 00:14:05.928
So, I see you've met my grandson.

00:14:06.012 --> 00:14:07.638
Don't you think he's precious?

00:14:08.514 --> 00:14:10.099
He's just like his father, isn't he?

00:14:10.808 --> 00:14:12.935
Do you realize now
what a terrible woman you are?

00:14:13.603 --> 00:14:16.439
You nearly let Junik die
without a child like that.

00:14:17.607 --> 00:14:20.151
We'll be living together
before you know it.

00:14:21.152 --> 00:14:23.863
We should've done it sooner
while Junik was still alive.

00:14:27.575 --> 00:14:28.910
Miji.

00:14:28.993 --> 00:14:31.954
Remember the list we made
for donating my inheritance?

00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:34.791
Carry it out immediately.

00:14:36.834 --> 00:14:39.754
Ms. Seo, I don't know
what you're referring to.

00:14:41.297 --> 00:14:43.925
Is this a scam call?

00:14:47.178 --> 00:14:48.346
What's wrong?

00:14:48.888 --> 00:14:52.100
Did you promise Hanna
a piece of my inheritance once you get it?

00:14:52.683 --> 00:14:55.019
Because you seem surprised.

00:15:23.297 --> 00:15:24.674
Do you know a place

00:15:26.592 --> 00:15:28.553
where I won't have to…

00:15:30.721 --> 00:15:32.473
see or hear anyone?

00:17:06.067 --> 00:17:07.526
There's something I wanna do.

00:17:37.598 --> 00:17:39.100
So this is what it feels like.

00:18:07.044 --> 00:18:11.966
The first time you fire a gun,
the hardest part is handling the recoil.

00:18:36.866 --> 00:18:37.867
That was good.

00:18:38.909 --> 00:18:40.328
You're off to a great start.

00:19:32.922 --> 00:19:34.590
You stood your ground the whole time

00:19:36.050 --> 00:19:37.051
without wavering.

00:20:08.666 --> 00:20:09.667
Mr. Paik.

00:20:21.053 --> 00:20:27.351
I finally understood today
what kind of security you provide.

00:20:29.729 --> 00:20:31.689
I made it through the day thanks to you.

00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:38.863
Is your hand in pain?

00:20:49.915 --> 00:20:53.627
Shooting often causes
some muscle tightness.

00:21:58.651 --> 00:22:02.029
Here's the current situation
on the Korean Peninsula.

00:22:02.613 --> 00:22:06.909
In the skies, U.S. recon flights have
increased significantly…

00:22:09.662 --> 00:22:14.208
and more than three carrier strike groups
are heading toward the region.

00:22:15.167 --> 00:22:18.295
The US is deploying its full range
of strategic assets

00:22:18.379 --> 00:22:22.049
including bombers, fighter jets,
advanced weaponry, supplies, and troops.

00:22:22.842 --> 00:22:25.761
They're being deployed,
and much closer to the peninsula.

00:22:28.889 --> 00:22:30.683
"THREE YEARS
OF US MILITARY RULE:"

00:22:30.766 --> 00:22:32.268
"WHAT REMAINS
IN OUR SUBCONSCIOUS?"

00:22:32.351 --> 00:22:34.478
What do you think this means?

00:22:35.396 --> 00:22:38.399
A US attack on North Korea is imminent.

00:22:39.024 --> 00:22:40.734
War will break out

00:22:41.652 --> 00:22:43.404
within the next few days.

00:22:46.532 --> 00:22:47.533
Sir.

00:22:49.326 --> 00:22:50.744
What exactly are you talking about?

00:22:50.828 --> 00:22:55.875
I have lived my entire life fearing war.

00:22:56.458 --> 00:23:00.129
But I've never been as afraid
as I am today.

00:23:00.212 --> 00:23:01.922
The signs of war I only imagined

00:23:02.006 --> 00:23:04.592
have suddenly appeared all at once
over the past couple of days!

00:23:04.675 --> 00:23:07.303
Yeah, okay. But what exactly
are you saying we do?

00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:10.472
There's really nothing
that we can do about it, right?

00:23:10.556 --> 00:23:12.766
We have to do something.

00:23:13.517 --> 00:23:15.811
We need to take to the streets

00:23:15.895 --> 00:23:17.688
and stand up against war,

00:23:17.771 --> 00:23:21.734
and hold candlelight vigils for peace,
pray wherever you can

00:23:21.817 --> 00:23:26.030
and appeal to politicians
and the international community…

00:23:28.157 --> 00:23:29.450
that we do not…

00:23:31.577 --> 00:23:33.662
want war in our land.

00:23:36.749 --> 00:23:39.710
This is the list of organizations
for the donation.

00:23:39.793 --> 00:23:43.088
I've reviewed their financial reports,
and audit statements.

00:23:43.172 --> 00:23:46.300
I selected ones that award at least 85%
of their total revenue

00:23:46.383 --> 00:23:48.093
to public service projects.

00:23:48.177 --> 00:23:50.512
By sector there are 20 organizations
in social welfare…

00:23:50.596 --> 00:23:52.348
{\an8}"PRESIDENT CHAE
RETURNS FROM CHINA VISIT"

00:23:52.431 --> 00:23:54.224
{\an8}"MEETING WITH CHINESE PRESIDENT
CANCELED"

00:23:54.308 --> 00:23:56.226
{\an8}…15 in research and scholarships,
10 in education,

00:23:56.310 --> 00:23:58.896
six in health care, four in arts
and culture, and five in other areas.

00:24:06.195 --> 00:24:07.488
Dr. Im.

00:24:13.619 --> 00:24:14.662
Whose side are you on?

00:24:21.543 --> 00:24:23.128
The side of our people.

00:24:24.546 --> 00:24:26.840
I'm on the side of our people.

00:24:26.924 --> 00:24:30.052
I wish to see reunification
in my lifetime.

00:24:30.135 --> 00:24:31.887
So we can live with…

00:24:31.971 --> 00:24:33.889
You're spreading rumors
about war breaking out,

00:24:33.973 --> 00:24:35.724
encouraging people to riot.

00:24:35.808 --> 00:24:38.978
What are you, a spy?

00:24:41.522 --> 00:24:43.482
- You talk too much.
- If you're scared of war,

00:24:43.565 --> 00:24:46.735
then just die
and stop crying for attention.

00:24:51.657 --> 00:24:55.035
Dr. Im. What happened to you?

00:24:57.705 --> 00:24:59.623
Oh, Munju.

00:25:02.042 --> 00:25:03.752
We're running out of time.

00:25:11.385 --> 00:25:12.720
Listen carefully.

00:25:14.138 --> 00:25:18.434
Something happened over in Beijing.

00:25:19.268 --> 00:25:22.146
Well, President,
it's time for you to choose.

00:25:22.646 --> 00:25:24.648
Will you lose the North to China?

00:25:25.649 --> 00:25:29.028
Or will you win this war
and unify the peninsula during your term?

00:25:29.111 --> 00:25:32.072
I think the US convinced Chae Kyungsin

00:25:32.156 --> 00:25:35.826
that a first strike is the only option.

00:25:36.618 --> 00:25:38.203
War is coming soon.

00:25:38.871 --> 00:25:40.330
There are three clear signs.

00:25:40.414 --> 00:25:45.377
First, bunker busters to destroy
the North's underground bases.

00:25:46.712 --> 00:25:48.922
They're being stockpiled in Okinawa.

00:25:49.006 --> 00:25:51.800
A significant portion of that
has already been deployed.

00:25:52.593 --> 00:25:53.719
Second,

00:25:53.802 --> 00:25:56.096
the US strategic nuclear submarine,

00:25:56.597 --> 00:25:57.765
USS Michigan.

00:25:58.474 --> 00:25:59.558
Not long ago,

00:25:59.641 --> 00:26:01.435
a Russian reconnaissance satellite

00:26:01.518 --> 00:26:05.064
detected it departing from
the Port of Yokosuka.

00:26:05.147 --> 00:26:06.482
BUNKER BUSTERS
SSBN USS MICHIGAN

00:26:07.524 --> 00:26:09.401
And the most definitive sign

00:26:10.402 --> 00:26:12.446
is the evacuation of US citizens.

00:26:13.030 --> 00:26:16.658
If the U.S. military radio plays
Sinatra's version

00:26:16.742 --> 00:26:21.997
of "Have Yourself A Merry
Little Christmas," then it's really over.

00:26:23.624 --> 00:26:27.127
It's a signal that the bombing will
start in 12 hours.

00:26:32.674 --> 00:26:34.134
That information's reliable?

00:26:34.635 --> 00:26:36.929
I truly wish it were wrong.

00:26:43.644 --> 00:26:46.313
Ms. Seo, we have to go. People are coming.

00:26:46.814 --> 00:26:48.774
It's the second-to-the-last bed there.

00:26:49.274 --> 00:26:51.652
Dr. Im, come with me.
I'll get you somewhere safe.

00:26:51.735 --> 00:26:52.736
No…

00:26:53.445 --> 00:26:56.532
I no longer have any power.

00:26:58.158 --> 00:27:01.995
You're the only one, Munju,
who can stop this.

00:27:02.079 --> 00:27:04.039
Go and tell people.

00:27:04.123 --> 00:27:06.291
Do whatever it takes.

00:27:06.375 --> 00:27:07.543
What do you want?

00:27:07.626 --> 00:27:09.753
We're carrying out official duties.
Please step aside.

00:27:12.005 --> 00:27:13.340
Can you show us a warrant?

00:27:13.423 --> 00:27:14.550
No.

00:27:15.759 --> 00:27:17.427
We're not required to present a warrant.

00:27:17.511 --> 00:27:19.263
This obviously is an illegal arrest.

00:27:19.346 --> 00:27:21.140
- Dr. Im has done nothing wrong.
- Arrest him.

00:27:21.223 --> 00:27:22.599
Step aside.

00:27:28.981 --> 00:27:31.275
This is a hospital! What are you doing?

00:27:36.446 --> 00:27:39.283
They're with a criminal.

00:27:39.366 --> 00:27:40.826
We're arresting a spy.

00:27:40.909 --> 00:27:43.328
- Hey, hey, stop them from taking photos!
- No photos. Stop!

00:27:43.412 --> 00:27:45.622
- Hey, stop them!
- Wait, wait, hold on.

00:27:46.748 --> 00:27:49.209
- Okay. Let's go.
- Dr. Im.

00:27:54.756 --> 00:27:56.758
Someone go get me a wheelchair.

00:28:32.753 --> 00:28:33.754
Hi, Miji.

00:28:33.837 --> 00:28:37.174
- Ms. Seo, I figured it out.
- What?

00:28:37.257 --> 00:28:38.926
This is the report of the text messages

00:28:39.009 --> 00:28:40.552
from Mr. Jang's secret phone.

00:28:41.053 --> 00:28:42.054
Here.

00:28:43.889 --> 00:28:44.890
What are these?

00:28:44.973 --> 00:28:47.184
They look really suspicious, right?

00:28:47.267 --> 00:28:50.103
Almost like some coded messages
from North Korea.

00:28:50.187 --> 00:28:52.648
So I Googled it, and it turns out

00:28:52.731 --> 00:28:55.817
a lot of people
have gotten messages just like this.

00:28:56.443 --> 00:28:58.987
{\an8}It's just a system error
from the telecom provider.

00:28:59.071 --> 00:29:02.115
You know,
like those automated texts that flood in

00:29:02.199 --> 00:29:04.034
right after you activate a new phone.

00:29:04.868 --> 00:29:08.205
But when I looked closer,
I noticed slight differences,

00:29:08.288 --> 00:29:09.539
just a character or two.

00:29:11.875 --> 00:29:13.293
That's when it hit me.

00:29:13.377 --> 00:29:16.380
The SincereMail password
is 15 characters long.

00:29:16.463 --> 00:29:17.714
Fifteen…

00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:37.526
Dear Junik,
it all started about a month ago,

00:29:38.110 --> 00:29:40.654
when three crew members
from a North Korean submarine

00:29:40.737 --> 00:29:41.989
defected to the US.

00:29:42.656 --> 00:29:44.241
According to their statements…

00:29:44.783 --> 00:29:48.412
That submarine was
a 10,000-ton class, not 3,000 tons.

00:29:48.495 --> 00:29:52.416
It wasn't just some kind of modified
old Soviet diesel sub.

00:29:52.499 --> 00:29:54.751
The new submarine
being built in North Korea

00:29:54.835 --> 00:29:58.922
is not an upgraded version of
the Romeo-class as initially believed…

00:29:59.006 --> 00:30:02.801
The hull was black,
at least 140 meters long.

00:30:02.884 --> 00:30:07.305
…but actually
a highly advanced 10,000-ton class SSBN.

00:30:07.389 --> 00:30:09.725
…140 meters long, maybe 10 meters across.

00:30:09.808 --> 00:30:11.852
A crew of about six times the KSS2.

00:30:11.935 --> 00:30:13.603
Space for a 160 crew.

00:30:13.687 --> 00:30:17.107
And it had small wings that were
on either side of the bow.

00:30:17.190 --> 00:30:20.777
It had 16 vertical launch tubes,
arranged in two rows of eight.

00:30:21.570 --> 00:30:25.365
They appeared to be for large missiles,
with a diameter of around two meters.

00:30:25.949 --> 00:30:27.034
Two meters in diameter.

00:30:27.617 --> 00:30:31.788
So that's 16 vertical instruments
on the bridge in two rows of eight.

00:30:42.090 --> 00:30:43.842
The whole agency was upended,

00:30:43.925 --> 00:30:47.637
and everyone started poring through all
available satellite images of North Korea.

00:30:48.305 --> 00:30:51.725
Eventually, they identified
an object in a few of those images,

00:30:51.808 --> 00:30:54.895
just a shadow, but enough
to start planning the operation.

00:31:01.193 --> 00:31:04.488
It's an exact match. This confirms
the submarine crew's statements.

00:31:04.571 --> 00:31:07.032
Well, we'll have to authenticate it,

00:31:07.115 --> 00:31:10.535
but this does suggest
a high probability that they're the same.

00:31:10.619 --> 00:31:12.079
Then we must take immediate action.

00:31:12.162 --> 00:31:15.624
Well, of course, why hesitate
when the evidence is so clear, huh?

00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:20.170
I didn't believe it.

00:31:21.129 --> 00:31:24.424
How could anyone build a submarine
without so much as a whisper leaking out?

00:31:26.093 --> 00:31:28.929
What if
the North Korean defectors are lying?

00:31:29.638 --> 00:31:32.057
You made a similar mistake
during the Iraq War.

00:31:33.433 --> 00:31:35.018
That's what I've been saying.

00:31:35.685 --> 00:31:37.896
So I wanted to hear the story
from them directly.

00:31:38.688 --> 00:31:40.315
But then something happened.

00:31:41.483 --> 00:31:43.401
- Put your hands up on the wall.
- No…

00:31:50.325 --> 00:31:52.702
One crew member shot the other two

00:31:53.453 --> 00:31:54.871
and then turned the gun on himself.

00:31:54.955 --> 00:31:57.040
See if they're dead. See.

00:32:02.129 --> 00:32:04.131
But the whole incident
was swept under the rug.

00:32:05.132 --> 00:32:09.803
The three aircraft carriers,
Roosevelt, Reagan, and Carl Vinson,

00:32:09.886 --> 00:32:13.473
will deploy to Korea to face
a potential crisis on the peninsula.

00:32:13.974 --> 00:32:17.185
Preparations for a strike
on North Korea are still underway,

00:32:17.269 --> 00:32:20.480
and the only evidence we have
are the crew's statements.

00:32:22.607 --> 00:32:24.067
Mr. President, may I have a word?

00:32:24.985 --> 00:32:27.904
Mr. President, we have to ascertain
whether these submarines are real.

00:32:27.988 --> 00:32:31.158
We can't move forward based on
the testimony of three dead witnesses!

00:32:31.700 --> 00:32:32.701
Sir!

00:32:36.079 --> 00:32:37.080
Junik,

00:32:37.664 --> 00:32:39.541
I decided to take matters
into my own hands

00:32:39.624 --> 00:32:42.043
and find out whether
that submarine really exists.

00:32:42.127 --> 00:32:43.295
Thank you.

00:32:43.879 --> 00:32:45.547
I've been scouring records,
trying to find out

00:32:45.630 --> 00:32:47.549
who's been buying submarine components.

00:32:47.632 --> 00:32:50.051
Hey, I'm still missing 2021.

00:32:50.135 --> 00:32:52.596
As I suspected, I came up with nothing.

00:32:52.679 --> 00:32:54.556
There wasn't a shred of evidence

00:32:54.639 --> 00:32:58.768
indicating that North Korea is building
a 10,000-ton nuclear submarine.

00:32:59.477 --> 00:33:00.478
However…

00:33:03.190 --> 00:33:06.109
there was one name I kept coming across

00:33:06.193 --> 00:33:08.570
over and over again.

00:33:11.531 --> 00:33:15.410
Somebody who imported
structural steel plates from Poland…

00:33:18.580 --> 00:33:20.832
precision sensors from Switzerland…

00:33:24.878 --> 00:33:26.880
{\an8}and engineers from Sweden.

00:33:31.676 --> 00:33:33.720
{\an8}The name was Stella Young,

00:33:34.679 --> 00:33:36.598
an American arms lobbyist.

00:33:40.685 --> 00:33:43.939
Wait, this Stella Young is saying

00:33:45.357 --> 00:33:48.485
the North Koreans have the capability
to build a nuclear submarine?

00:33:48.568 --> 00:33:51.238
I heard a rumor that, for the past
five years, she's been claiming

00:33:51.321 --> 00:33:55.575
that North Korea does have the capability
to build a 10,000-ton submarine.

00:33:55.659 --> 00:33:57.452
So I started looking into her.

00:34:04.251 --> 00:34:05.585
PASSPORT SCAN

00:34:09.422 --> 00:34:10.423
{\an8}STELLA YOUNG, USA

00:34:13.718 --> 00:34:16.096
Can you issue
a passport without a photo?

00:34:16.179 --> 00:34:18.056
I've seen it once before.

00:34:18.139 --> 00:34:21.351
The passport of a Romanian asset I saw
had no picture.

00:34:27.315 --> 00:34:30.318
Stella Young, is she a spy?

00:34:31.695 --> 00:34:34.406
Well, according to
her immigration records,

00:34:34.489 --> 00:34:36.908
she entered South Korea ten years ago

00:34:37.659 --> 00:34:38.868
and never returned.

00:34:40.578 --> 00:34:43.081
I suspect she's still in South Korea.

00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:45.834
Please find her, Junik.

00:34:45.917 --> 00:34:48.670
It's the only way to solve
the mystery behind this submarine.

00:34:52.257 --> 00:34:58.805
And this is the last e-mail
that Assemblyman Jang sent him.

00:35:00.056 --> 00:35:01.516
Dear Anderson,

00:35:02.475 --> 00:35:05.520
I think I know that woman, Stella Young.

00:35:06.479 --> 00:35:08.481
I'll e-mail you once I sort things out.

00:35:13.570 --> 00:35:15.155
And two days later,

00:35:15.238 --> 00:35:16.906
Junik was killed.

00:35:16.990 --> 00:35:20.076
Do you think Stella Young was behind it?

00:35:22.495 --> 00:35:25.206
{\an8}The US Navy's Ohio-class
strategic nuclear submarine,

00:35:25.290 --> 00:35:29.044
{\an8}the USS Michigan, will arrive at
the Busan operational base shortly.

00:35:29.127 --> 00:35:31.338
It is highly unusual for the US Navy

00:35:31.421 --> 00:35:33.673
to dock a submarine
at a foreign military port

00:35:33.757 --> 00:35:35.550
and disclose it openly.

00:35:35.634 --> 00:35:37.802
- Is there a reason behind this?
- Right.

00:35:37.886 --> 00:35:41.598
Uh, USS Michigan is one of the largest
strategic nuclear submarines in the world,

00:35:41.681 --> 00:35:44.934
measuring 170.6 meters in length,
12.8 meters in width…

00:35:45.018 --> 00:35:47.228
Everything's happening
just as Dr. Im said.

00:35:47.812 --> 00:35:49.606
"SIGNS OF WAR"

00:35:49.689 --> 00:35:51.524
"U.S. CIVILIAN EVACUATION
OPERATION NEO"

00:35:51.608 --> 00:35:54.069
If those really are signs of war…

00:35:54.152 --> 00:35:56.780
There's only one thing left now.

00:36:33.191 --> 00:36:35.735
The Father, the Son
and the Holy Spirit. Amen.

00:36:39.364 --> 00:36:40.824
I know why you're here.

00:36:42.617 --> 00:36:43.827
You must be in agony.

00:36:51.459 --> 00:36:52.961
Is there a war coming soon?

00:36:54.838 --> 00:36:55.839
Today?

00:36:57.674 --> 00:36:58.675
Tomorrow?

00:36:59.718 --> 00:37:02.887
Seo Munju. You.

00:37:02.971 --> 00:37:05.056
Even when things were
at their worst between us,

00:37:06.015 --> 00:37:07.517
I still believed in you.

00:37:08.059 --> 00:37:10.895
I thought we were both fighting
to stop war in our own ways.

00:37:12.689 --> 00:37:15.483
You used to send me notes
before negotiations.

00:37:15.567 --> 00:37:18.027
What we could compromise on
and what was nonnegotiable.

00:37:18.945 --> 00:37:21.030
So how could you back down like this?

00:37:21.114 --> 00:37:22.824
What the hell happened?

00:37:22.907 --> 00:37:25.952
What made you accept the possibility
of war on the Korean Peninsula?

00:37:33.668 --> 00:37:35.336
As I walked into the church,

00:37:36.755 --> 00:37:38.798
my whole life flashed before my eyes.

00:37:38.882 --> 00:37:40.508
All the times I almost died.

00:37:42.510 --> 00:37:44.596
If only I had died back then.

00:37:45.930 --> 00:37:48.475
You'll never comprehend the trauma

00:37:48.558 --> 00:37:51.603
of having to choose between the lives
and deaths of millions.

00:37:53.730 --> 00:37:55.190
Consider yourself fortunate.

00:37:55.690 --> 00:37:59.611
I would have never chosen war,
no matter the circumstances.

00:38:03.948 --> 00:38:05.158
You don't know that.

00:38:06.951 --> 00:38:08.578
You would've chosen differently?

00:38:09.704 --> 00:38:11.414
What could you have possibly done?

00:38:20.423 --> 00:38:22.759
Ambassador,
may I have a moment of your time?

00:38:22.842 --> 00:38:24.219
I could use your wisdom.

00:38:37.524 --> 00:38:38.733
"Don't you see

00:38:39.734 --> 00:38:44.906
the Yellow River's waters
descend from Heaven, rushing into the sea,

00:38:44.989 --> 00:38:46.616
never to return?"

00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:51.454
"Don't you see the shining mirror,
grieving in the high hall for your hair,

00:38:52.038 --> 00:38:54.624
silken black at dawn,
that dusk has turned to snow?"

00:38:56.125 --> 00:38:57.335
Hello, Ambassador.

00:38:59.045 --> 00:39:01.756
Your eyes have lost their usual serenity.

00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:03.007
You seem worried.

00:39:03.091 --> 00:39:04.551
They're wide with worry.

00:39:05.093 --> 00:39:06.427
Are you concerned about tonight?

00:39:07.762 --> 00:39:10.306
Is China aware of the situation,
Ambassador?

00:39:11.015 --> 00:39:13.810
Why would China tolerate a war in Korea?

00:39:15.854 --> 00:39:17.146
Do you want this war?

00:39:18.523 --> 00:39:19.858
Everyone wants it.

00:39:20.650 --> 00:39:22.819
I see there's a reason behind this.

00:39:24.070 --> 00:39:25.697
A reason driving this war.

00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:31.411
Ambassador, have you ever seen
the Yellow River flood with your own eyes?

00:39:32.245 --> 00:39:33.371
No, I have not.

00:39:33.454 --> 00:39:36.040
The water is vast and powerful.

00:39:36.541 --> 00:39:38.126
It sweeps away everything in its path.

00:39:38.209 --> 00:39:39.627
It's futile to resist it.

00:39:40.962 --> 00:39:44.007
It's foolish to think that mere mortals
can bend the will of the heavens.

00:39:46.301 --> 00:39:47.677
You cannot fathom this, Ambassador,

00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:51.222
because you have never seen
something truly vast.

00:39:52.265 --> 00:39:54.475
Now, I understand
you wish to prevent this war,

00:39:55.184 --> 00:39:56.561
but there's nothing you can do,

00:39:58.187 --> 00:39:59.314
except pray.

00:40:00.857 --> 00:40:05.695
Pray the war ends swiftly
like a summer shower, fierce but fleeting.

00:40:07.071 --> 00:40:09.908
Because if things go wrong,
it could escalate to World War III.

00:40:12.368 --> 00:40:14.495
"A small mountain
can overshadow a great one,

00:40:14.579 --> 00:40:16.164
simply because it stands closer."

00:40:18.750 --> 00:40:20.752
What does that mean, Your Excellency?

00:40:20.835 --> 00:40:24.130
It's an old poem written by
a Korean man named Chong Yagyong

00:40:24.213 --> 00:40:25.965
when he was seven years old.

00:40:26.049 --> 00:40:29.260
I believe a small mountain
can overcome a big one

00:40:29.344 --> 00:40:32.013
because I'm young and naive like him.

00:40:32.972 --> 00:40:36.100
So… I'll do what I can.

00:40:38.227 --> 00:40:39.520
So stubborn.

00:40:41.397 --> 00:40:43.316
So beautiful, so smart.

00:40:45.193 --> 00:40:46.527
And yet, you will die.

00:41:09.634 --> 00:41:13.554
{\an8}SUYEONG BAY, BUSAN

00:41:24.857 --> 00:41:27.402
SUYEONG BAY FIREWORKS FESTIVAL
A TALK WITH CANDIDATE SEO MUNJU

00:41:27.485 --> 00:41:29.070
My fellow Koreans.

00:41:29.570 --> 00:41:32.490
The people of Busan
on this Sunday evening.

00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:39.914
Tonight, I won't speak about myself.

00:41:41.958 --> 00:41:46.421
The reason I stand before you
is to warn you

00:41:47.922 --> 00:41:51.259
that a war could break out
before sunrise tomorrow.

00:41:58.641 --> 00:42:00.143
W-War?

00:42:01.019 --> 00:42:03.813
Did they say war?
How's that possible?

00:42:03.896 --> 00:42:05.690
Let me say this one more time.

00:42:07.233 --> 00:42:09.902
Within the next 24 hours,

00:42:09.986 --> 00:42:13.614
the United States is likely
to launch an attack on North Korea,

00:42:14.157 --> 00:42:15.533
and there's a very real chance

00:42:15.616 --> 00:42:18.161
the Korean Peninsula could get wiped out.

00:42:25.501 --> 00:42:27.086
"THE US WILL BEGIN ITS ATTACK…"

00:42:33.593 --> 00:42:35.053
{\an8}Standing by for orders.

00:42:35.136 --> 00:42:39.265
{\an8}Two days ago, the President
of South Korea accepted the US notice

00:42:39.348 --> 00:42:41.309
of an impending strike on North Korea.

00:42:41.392 --> 00:42:44.228
{\an8}It is now 7:02 p.m.,
and President Chae Kyungsin has likely

00:42:44.312 --> 00:42:48.691
{\an8}taken shelter in an underground bunker
in preparation for the coming war.

00:42:49.734 --> 00:42:53.071
At 6:50 p.m., the official Blue House
Instagram posted

00:42:53.154 --> 00:42:56.282
a photo of the president
attending the People's Party convention,

00:42:56.365 --> 00:42:58.242
but that photo is fabricated.

00:42:59.619 --> 00:43:01.120
To those at the convention,

00:43:01.204 --> 00:43:06.667
if any of you have seen the president
after that time, please provide proof.

00:43:08.419 --> 00:43:11.089
Madam President, I just have one question.

00:43:12.381 --> 00:43:15.051
When your people stand
at the crossroads of life and death,

00:43:15.676 --> 00:43:19.472
will you really just remain hidden
inside a bunker?

00:43:25.228 --> 00:43:27.480
Special operation units will
arrive shortly.

00:43:28.314 --> 00:43:29.565
You need to make your decision.

00:43:30.733 --> 00:43:32.610
Stand by until further orders.

00:43:32.693 --> 00:43:33.694
Keep the target in sight.

00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:56.717
The US wants to start this war
because, a month ago,

00:43:56.801 --> 00:43:59.387
{\an8}they learned that North Korea
was building a nuclear submarine.

00:43:59.470 --> 00:44:02.265
{\an8}They believe this to be
their final opportunity

00:44:02.348 --> 00:44:04.976
{\an8}to safeguard their country
from a North Korean nuclear strike.

00:44:05.059 --> 00:44:07.311
Secretary of Defense. Immediately.

00:44:07.395 --> 00:44:11.107
But who will fight this war
on the Korean Peninsula? We will.

00:44:11.190 --> 00:44:14.735
Tonight, we all walked these very streets
with countless dreams.

00:44:15.319 --> 00:44:18.406
However, by tomorrow,
we will all share just one.

00:44:18.489 --> 00:44:22.243
That we, and those we care for,
can survive this.

00:44:28.624 --> 00:44:33.254
But what if the US is launching
this attack based on false intelligence?

00:44:33.838 --> 00:44:36.007
What if the submarine isn't even real?

00:44:36.090 --> 00:44:38.134
- The Zoom call. Get it going, come on.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:44:38.718 --> 00:44:42.430
And now, the U.S. Assistant Secretary
of State, Anderson Miller.

00:44:43.097 --> 00:44:44.182
Madam President.

00:44:48.102 --> 00:44:49.103
Hello.

00:44:49.187 --> 00:44:53.524
My name is Anderson Miller. American.

00:44:53.608 --> 00:44:55.943
Anderson,
we're surrounded by the police right now.

00:44:56.611 --> 00:44:59.697
But you must tell the truth,
no matter what.

00:44:59.780 --> 00:45:02.200
The submarine that the US is planning
to strike tonight.

00:45:02.283 --> 00:45:04.243
Is it real or fabricated?

00:45:04.952 --> 00:45:07.872
The only evidence
that this submarine exists

00:45:07.955 --> 00:45:12.877
{\an8}comes from the unverified testimony
of three North Korean defectors,

00:45:13.586 --> 00:45:17.381
one of whom committed suicide
after shooting his fellow crew members.

00:45:17.465 --> 00:45:20.551
- We must not take them at their word.
- Requesting entry order now.

00:45:20.635 --> 00:45:21.928
We can't wait any longer.

00:45:22.011 --> 00:45:23.930
Furthermore,
I received the following video.

00:45:25.890 --> 00:45:29.393
Actually, the truth is,
I've never seen that submarine.

00:45:30.853 --> 00:45:32.230
I've only heard rumors.

00:45:43.032 --> 00:45:44.033
What?

00:45:44.700 --> 00:45:46.327
Sir, I think you need to see this.

00:45:50.665 --> 00:45:53.251
Then how were you able to testify to it?

00:45:53.751 --> 00:45:56.254
The chief engineer explained
it to me in detail.

00:45:57.713 --> 00:46:01.133
I memorized it on my way over here.

00:46:01.217 --> 00:46:04.428
Why did your chief engineer
tell you to give false testimony?

00:46:05.346 --> 00:46:07.431
I guess that he was pushing for war.

00:46:09.934 --> 00:46:13.020
From this moment forward,
this assembly is deemed illegal.

00:46:13.104 --> 00:46:15.481
Disperse and leave the area immediately.

00:46:16.148 --> 00:46:18.484
The firecrackers are a sign.

00:46:18.567 --> 00:46:19.694
Fire at the first bang.

00:46:19.777 --> 00:46:21.237
From this moment forward,

00:46:21.320 --> 00:46:25.533
this assembly is deemed illegal.
Disperse and leave the area immediately.

00:46:25.616 --> 00:46:26.617
We're going in.

00:46:38.421 --> 00:46:39.422
What?

00:46:50.099 --> 00:46:52.059
I can only hope that I'm wrong about this.

00:46:52.143 --> 00:46:56.105
I'd rather be seen as someone spreading
rumors and inciting a riot!

00:47:00.901 --> 00:47:02.320
Please make that the case

00:47:02.403 --> 00:47:06.699
so that nothing happens tonight
and so we all wake up safely tomorrow.

00:47:07.325 --> 00:47:09.493
Hey, Ms. Seo!

00:47:11.537 --> 00:47:13.789
Please everyone, spread this message!

00:47:13.873 --> 00:47:14.999
Get 'em off! Now!

00:47:15.082 --> 00:47:17.918
Let's all work together to stop this war!

00:48:08.677 --> 00:48:10.054
Oh, shit.

00:49:05.568 --> 00:49:07.278
I'm fine. It doesn't hurt.

00:49:11.407 --> 00:49:13.033
Press this down for three minutes.

00:49:19.748 --> 00:49:20.875
Sanho.

00:49:21.959 --> 00:49:23.127
I'm really okay.

00:49:25.337 --> 00:49:26.464
I'm not.

00:49:48.527 --> 00:49:52.990
I'm gonna keep talking to you,
and I need you to keep responding, Munju.

00:49:53.574 --> 00:49:56.035
I need to make sure
you're breathing okay and staying alert.

00:50:05.044 --> 00:50:06.212
You were shot too?

00:50:10.674 --> 00:50:11.926
Look at my face.

00:50:13.093 --> 00:50:14.261
Don't look at anything else.

00:50:16.138 --> 00:50:17.306
Okay.

00:50:20.309 --> 00:50:22.394
I see a good amount of tissue damage.

00:50:25.231 --> 00:50:26.607
Bone and nerves are fine.

00:50:32.655 --> 00:50:34.490
Next part'll be more painful.

00:50:35.741 --> 00:50:37.034
You need stitches.

00:50:38.744 --> 00:50:39.912
Can it wait?

00:50:41.080 --> 00:50:42.081
Who's gonna do it?

00:50:42.164 --> 00:50:43.165
I am.

00:50:43.707 --> 00:50:45.626
No, no, wait. Come on.

00:50:46.210 --> 00:50:47.503
What about anesthesia?

00:50:47.586 --> 00:50:49.463
It'll be quicker
than giving you anesthesia.

00:50:59.974 --> 00:51:02.017
To protect your teeth
when you're clenching.

00:51:36.093 --> 00:51:37.886
Good job. You did really great.

00:51:43.976 --> 00:51:45.269
You're a good patient.

00:51:49.231 --> 00:51:50.482
I was screaming

00:51:51.775 --> 00:51:53.110
in my head.

00:51:53.193 --> 00:51:55.279
With this kind of injury in combat,

00:51:56.530 --> 00:51:58.699
you only get one minute for first aid,

00:51:58.782 --> 00:52:00.284
then you grab your gun again.

00:52:01.910 --> 00:52:03.537
Use a gun with this arm?

00:52:04.330 --> 00:52:05.456
Of course.

00:52:08.751 --> 00:52:10.711
If you wanna take down
the one who shot you.

00:52:22.389 --> 00:52:23.891
That bastard got lucky.

00:52:25.643 --> 00:52:26.685
Which one?

00:52:27.978 --> 00:52:29.396
The one who shot you.

00:52:31.774 --> 00:52:32.775
Why?

00:52:32.858 --> 00:52:34.568
If they had hit your bone…

00:52:38.238 --> 00:52:40.032
then I would've killed them.

00:53:03.055 --> 00:53:05.057
THE PRESIDENT
OF THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA

00:53:12.981 --> 00:53:19.154
This evening, I stand before you to speak
on the many concerns and uncertainties

00:53:19.238 --> 00:53:22.116
surrounding the security
of the Korean Peninsula.

00:53:26.036 --> 00:53:29.540
It's true, the US does have suspicions

00:53:29.623 --> 00:53:32.209
about the nuclear submarine
from North Korea.

00:53:34.962 --> 00:53:36.296
However,

00:53:36.839 --> 00:53:41.885
my firm belief is that the US
will not make any decisions

00:53:41.969 --> 00:53:45.723
until the existence of their weapon is
fully verified.

00:53:47.057 --> 00:53:50.811
You once said, "If you can understand
what the other party wants,

00:53:50.894 --> 00:53:52.730
negotiations will always succeed."

00:53:53.981 --> 00:53:56.734
I know what kind of president
you wanted to be.

00:53:57.568 --> 00:54:01.488
In the end, I'm sure you'll choose
the path that prevents war.

00:54:06.285 --> 00:54:09.163
"I CAN PROVE
THE SUBMARINE DOESN'T EXIST"

00:54:09.246 --> 00:54:11.206
This is my plan for tonight.

00:54:11.290 --> 00:54:13.250
I'm risking everything
with this proposition.

00:54:13.333 --> 00:54:15.878
Just let me finish what I have to say,

00:54:16.962 --> 00:54:18.839
and I'll help you step out of the bunker.

00:54:21.759 --> 00:54:25.429
No matter what happens,
I'm going to stay right here.

00:54:26.555 --> 00:54:30.642
I will do everything in my power
to stay as close to you as I can,

00:54:31.143 --> 00:54:33.771
and I will also protect peace
until the very end.

00:54:34.396 --> 00:54:35.981
My great fellow Koreans.

00:54:36.064 --> 00:54:38.692
Tonight, we must protect one another,

00:54:38.776 --> 00:54:40.569
and more than ever before,

00:54:41.695 --> 00:54:43.489
continue on as you normally would,

00:54:43.989 --> 00:54:48.285
trust the government
and follow our guidance.

00:54:52.456 --> 00:54:53.874
That's as far as it will go.

00:54:53.957 --> 00:54:55.417
I can't guarantee your safety.

00:54:56.793 --> 00:54:58.962
No matter what happens,
I never knew your plan.

00:54:59.796 --> 00:55:01.548
I warned you, didn't I?

00:55:01.632 --> 00:55:03.800
The Americans don't like you.

00:55:04.426 --> 00:55:05.761
Be careful.

00:55:10.265 --> 00:55:11.683
{\an8}My last question.

00:55:11.767 --> 00:55:13.852
{\an8}This couldn't have been easy for you.

00:55:13.936 --> 00:55:16.104
Why put yourself through all of this?

00:55:16.188 --> 00:55:19.107
Because the planned US attack
against North Korea

00:55:19.191 --> 00:55:23.237
was predicated on false information
from the very beginning.

00:55:23.320 --> 00:55:25.989
{\an8}What if this leads to war
on the Korean Peninsula

00:55:26.073 --> 00:55:29.201
costing tens of thousands of lives,
perhaps more,

00:55:29.284 --> 00:55:33.080
{\an8}and in the end, we find no trace
of this supposed submarine?

00:55:33.163 --> 00:55:35.707
I need a report
on the impact of this Anderson interview

00:55:35.791 --> 00:55:39.002
on the midterm elections
on my desk in three hours.

00:55:41.630 --> 00:55:44.174
If we'd attacked North Korea in 1994,

00:55:44.258 --> 00:55:46.635
they wouldn't have
a single nuclear bomb today.

00:55:47.135 --> 00:55:51.557
We missed the same opportunity in 2006
and again in 2017. Why?

00:55:52.391 --> 00:55:54.518
Because we're always so damn concerned

00:55:54.601 --> 00:55:58.230
about some midterm election
six months down the line.

00:55:58.313 --> 00:56:01.066
If we eliminate
the North Korean threat today,

00:56:01.149 --> 00:56:04.278
America will be thanking us
for goddamn decades!

00:56:12.160 --> 00:56:13.537
Where are we going?

00:56:13.620 --> 00:56:16.456
Catacomb has a cabin we can use.

00:56:19.167 --> 00:56:21.795
I just realized
I didn't plan the next step.

00:56:23.797 --> 00:56:26.008
I guess I thought it was all over.

00:57:15.557 --> 00:57:16.558
Is it warm?

00:57:22.064 --> 00:57:24.274
How long will it be before I heal?

00:57:25.567 --> 00:57:26.860
Three to four weeks.

00:57:27.694 --> 00:57:30.322
I won't be able to wash my hair
myself until then?

00:57:34.159 --> 00:57:35.327
I'm afraid not.

00:58:40.809 --> 00:58:42.310
Can you shoot with one arm?

00:58:53.363 --> 00:58:56.116
Even if you had only one arm
and one leg, you can still shoot.

00:58:59.661 --> 00:59:01.538
Even if you get shot in the heart,

00:59:01.621 --> 00:59:03.832
you'll still have a few seconds
before you die.

00:59:05.083 --> 00:59:06.918
What do you think
you should do in that moment?

00:59:09.129 --> 00:59:11.047
Shoot the guy who shot me.

00:59:22.100 --> 00:59:24.352
This gun has taken
over 20 lives already.

00:59:26.104 --> 00:59:30.150
It understands the human urge
to kill the enemy.

01:00:07.145 --> 01:00:08.772
I think this gun likes me.

01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:13.652
I want you…

01:00:16.321 --> 01:00:18.448
to become a dangerous person, Munju.

01:00:28.834 --> 01:00:30.210
Never had this before.

01:00:32.504 --> 01:00:35.549
In my hometown,
people put bracken in their chicken soup.

01:00:39.511 --> 01:00:40.512
You seem to like it.

01:00:40.595 --> 01:00:43.306
I haven't eaten this much
in at least ten years.

01:00:45.642 --> 01:00:47.602
You must've been pretty hungry then.

01:00:50.188 --> 01:00:52.858
I can always tell when someone's hungry.

01:00:55.986 --> 01:00:58.321
Ten years ago
I was eating a lot of peaches.

01:00:58.405 --> 01:01:01.616
I couldn't eat anything else,
my morning sickness was so bad.

01:01:03.326 --> 01:01:05.036
I called the baby Peach because of that.

01:01:07.289 --> 01:01:10.792
I don't think I've ever gotten that full
since back when I was pregnant.

01:01:14.546 --> 01:01:15.630
Boy or girl?

01:01:17.173 --> 01:01:18.174
A boy.

01:01:18.967 --> 01:01:20.844
He kicked nonstop.

01:01:21.428 --> 01:01:23.889
I thought for sure
he was gonna love soccer.

01:01:25.015 --> 01:01:26.016
So…

01:01:29.144 --> 01:01:32.063
when I was in that house,
I felt a little relieved

01:01:33.732 --> 01:01:36.610
knowing Junik had a son who liked soccer.

01:01:43.199 --> 01:01:44.534
But it's funny, you know?

01:01:46.244 --> 01:01:49.581
That woman said she wanted
to take away everything from me, but…

01:02:23.990 --> 01:02:26.409
I felt like I'd trade everything I had

01:02:27.953 --> 01:02:29.704
just to live in that house.

01:02:30.538 --> 01:02:33.375
I never thought I wanted that in life.

01:02:33.458 --> 01:02:34.834
Mom.

01:02:46.554 --> 01:02:47.555
Mom.

01:03:28.972 --> 01:03:31.766
Here's the weather
forecast from the US military…

01:03:31.850 --> 01:03:33.351
…for tomorrow.

01:03:33.977 --> 01:03:35.311
First up is Seoul.

01:03:35.395 --> 01:03:36.896
Tomorrow there'll be clear skies…

01:03:36.980 --> 01:03:39.524
We North Koreans

01:03:39.607 --> 01:03:41.860
think war can break out
at any given moment,

01:03:42.736 --> 01:03:44.154
so it wouldn't shock us.

01:03:44.904 --> 01:03:46.448
It wouldn't shock me either.

01:03:47.657 --> 01:03:48.658
That day at the church,

01:03:49.993 --> 01:03:52.037
we were the only ones undeterred.

01:03:52.537 --> 01:03:54.330
While everyone was running away
from death…

01:03:57.500 --> 01:03:59.002
…you ran toward it.

01:04:07.385 --> 01:04:09.804
What were you going to do
if war broke out, Sanho?

01:04:14.100 --> 01:04:16.144
If a nuclear bomb were coming,

01:04:16.811 --> 01:04:19.314
I'd wanna be with the person I love.

01:04:20.899 --> 01:04:23.026
You said you had family
in the North, right?

01:04:25.653 --> 01:04:27.697
Did I keep you from being with them?

01:04:28.948 --> 01:04:29.949
No.

01:04:42.128 --> 01:04:43.838
Now I just want to be here.

01:04:51.638 --> 01:04:52.931
That bullet…

01:04:57.185 --> 01:04:59.229
I should've taken it instead of you.

01:05:08.238 --> 01:05:09.864
Should I not say things like this?

01:05:14.285 --> 01:05:15.954
I never wanted…

01:05:18.915 --> 01:05:21.042
to feel happy again.

01:06:34.073 --> 01:06:36.701
We couldn't stop this war after all.

01:06:43.208 --> 01:06:44.417
For one last time…

01:06:48.421 --> 01:06:50.089
I want you to pretend…

01:06:56.304 --> 01:06:58.223
this is just an ordinary day.

01:07:13.112 --> 01:07:16.658
Attention, citizens. This is
the Civil Defense Alert Control Center,

01:07:16.741 --> 01:07:19.744
of Ministry of the Interior and Safety.
This is not a drill.

01:07:19.827 --> 01:07:22.497
The preliminary warning has been issued.

01:07:22.997 --> 01:07:26.334
All citizens are instructed
to immediately prepare for evacuation

01:07:26.417 --> 01:07:30.546
and proceed to the nearest underground
shelter in an orderly manner.

01:07:30.630 --> 01:07:32.131
This is not a drill.
