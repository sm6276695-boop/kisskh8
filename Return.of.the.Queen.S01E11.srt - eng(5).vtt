00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:09.479
Years ago, you and my brother

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.280
were on your honeymoon overseas

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.080
when the accident happened.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:15.640
My brother, Lu Sinan,

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:16.800
died at the scene,

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.220
and you were severely injured

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:20.560
and taken

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.760
to the largest central hospital there.

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.120
However, you did not undergo surgery

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.240
at that hospital.

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:27.600
After completing

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.000
the police questioning,

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.000
you secretly transferred
to another hospital.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.460
Over the next three times,

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.680
even though you cooperated with the police

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.640
and took part in the investigations,

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:36.800
both your orthopedic surgery

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.130
and where you recovered

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.260
remained a complete mystery.

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.240
The foreign authorities

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.170
arrested the driver responsible,

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.120

it was classified

why did you suddenly transfer
to another hospital?

During these three years,

Where did you recover?

Yes,

your brother and I

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.920
were on our honeymoon at a hotel abroad.

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:59.720
The last thing

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.250
your brother said to me was,

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:02.840
"In the next life,

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:04.810
I would love me too."

Where I've been these past three years,

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.290

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.320
Everything you say is irrelevant.

Even though you were involved

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.480
and seriously injured,

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:37.840

to kill your brother?

What would I gain

from that?

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:02.480

Please calm down, sir.

00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:19.360
Is this how a big hotel
takes advantage of its guests?

00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:19.680
Sir.

00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:20.200
