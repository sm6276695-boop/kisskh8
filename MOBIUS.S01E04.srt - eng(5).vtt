I've observed that

you're the one

00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:26.280
who has stayed committed to your position

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:27.810
without any distractions.

00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:30.320
Sit down.

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:36.070
I called you here because I wanted to

00:13:36.070 --> 00:13:37.000
discuss things.

00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:38.480
With the current situation

00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:41.590
no matter

00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:42.360
who takes over

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:43.510
the chief scientist position,

00:13:43.510 --> 00:13:44.200
it will definitely trigger

00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:45.270
a new round of conflicts.

00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:46.440
But we must quickly select

00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:47.440
a representative.

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:48.440
Otherwise, the follow-up work

00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:49.370
cannot proceed.

00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:51.390
So your intention

00:13:51.390 --> 00:13:52.720
is to ask me

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:54.910
if I have any recommendations?

00:13:54.910 --> 00:13:55.670
I want

00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:58.000
you to step up.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.270
You think I can do it?

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:11.190
Just tell me your honest thoughts.

00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:20.750
I do have such ambition,

00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:21.320
but now...

00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:22.030
I was afraid you

00:14:22.030 --> 00:14:23.560
didn't have such ambition.

00:14:27.890 --> 00:14:29.090
It's good that you do.

00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:38.070
To be honest...

00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:43.080
I might not have much time left.

00:14:44.070 --> 00:14:45.580
Han and Tang are both gone.

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:47.960
At any moment, I could also...

00:14:47.990 --> 00:14:48.960
Also what?

00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:56.720
Nothing.

00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:01.140
It doesn't matter.

00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:06.150
Even the Moma Group doesn't matter.

00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:08.550
Even if all these buildings

00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:09.790
were razed to the ground before my eyes,

00:15:09.790 --> 00:15:11.390
I wouldn't feel a thing.

00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:16.160
But the genetic research cannot stop.

00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:19.180
Only you would understand

00:15:21.410 --> 00:15:22.410
what I'm feeling.

00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:26.720
From the first day

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:27.840
you walked into my office,

00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:28.550
I knew

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:30.450
we were the same kind of people.

00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:32.080
No matter how much profit

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:33.550
genetic research brings,

00:15:33.550 --> 00:15:35.390
we are scientists first.

00:15:41.510 --> 00:15:42.510
I was thinking...

00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:45.630
If I appoint you directly
as chief scientist,

00:15:45.630 --> 00:15:46.910
people might not accept it.

00:15:46.910 --> 00:15:48.790
It's better to leave that position
vacant for now.

00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:50.120
I'll temporarily appoint you as

00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:51.150
Assistant to the Chief Scientist.

00:15:51.150 --> 00:15:52.120
This way, the entire research team

00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:53.650
will be under your control.

00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:58.320
If that works for you,

00:15:58.550 --> 00:15:59.630
I'll announce your appointment

00:15:59.630 --> 00:16:01.890
at the upcoming shareholders' meeting,

00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:03.240
Will the shareholders agree?

00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:04.240
I'll handle them.

00:16:09.070 --> 00:16:10.830
Thank you for your trust, Mr. Mo.

00:16:10.830 --> 00:16:12.870
I'll work hard on my research.

00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:14.600
I believe in you.

00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:16.930
Let's go.

00:16:22.510 --> 00:16:23.200
An Lan.

00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:24.840
Come in during the second half

00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:25.720
of the meeting.

00:16:26.210 --> 00:16:27.740
Wait for me in the rest area.

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:34.650
A multi-vehicle collision occurred

00:16:34.650 --> 00:16:35.480
at M15 Junction

00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:37.150
near Highway 1,

00:16:37.270 --> 00:16:38.720
resulting in three deaths

00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:39.960
and many seriously injured.

00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:40.550
Currently,

00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:42.600
paramedics have rushed to the scene

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:43.670
for rescue.

00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:49.550
Do you know Mr. Mo's wife?

00:16:50.750 --> 00:16:53.030
Mrs. Mo rarely comes to the company.

00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:54.360
She only appears

00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:55.320
during shareholder meetings.

00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:56.660
How's their relationship?

00:16:56.660 --> 00:16:57.860
How would I know that?

00:16:57.990 --> 00:16:59.790
That's between them as a couple.

00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:16.440
Police.

00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:33.830
Temporarily relinquish
control of the group?

00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:37.980
What exactly are you all suggesting?

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:47.560
Mr. Mo, you're currently

00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:49.400
facing death threats.

00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:51.160
This is not only for

00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:52.420
the company's future.

00:17:52.750 --> 00:17:53.960
It's also for

00:17:54.350 --> 00:17:55.610
your personal safety.

00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:57.200
If you choose to

00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:59.790
temporarily step down
from managing the company now,

00:17:59.790 --> 00:18:00.640
perhaps

00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:03.350
Squid will spare you too.

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:08.070
But I have two questions.

00:18:08.110 --> 00:18:08.640
First,

00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:10.350
how long is "temporarily?"

00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:11.000
Second,

00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:12.400
if I step down,

00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:15.200
who will take over
the company's daily operations?

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:15.680
You?

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:20.820
That's not your concern anymore.

00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:21.990
When the time comes,

00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:23.550
the general shareholders' meeting

00:18:23.550 --> 00:18:24.880
will elect someone new.

00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:27.550
But whether

00:18:27.550 --> 00:18:30.750
to terminate your management rights
over the group or not

00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:32.200
can be voted on today.

00:18:41.030 --> 00:18:42.960
You inherited shares,

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:44.550
not the position.

00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:45.480
You're sitting in

00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:46.510
your father's office

00:18:46.510 --> 00:18:47.750
and attending this

00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:48.680
internal management meeting

00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:51.110
because I respected
your father Han Song,

00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:52.510
not you.

00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:01.130
Since I've inherited the shares,

00:19:02.330 --> 00:19:03.930
I have the right to vote.

00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:05.790
I approve of

00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:08.200
removing Mo Yuanzhi's

00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:11.160
management rights at Moma Biotechnology.

00:19:38.430 --> 00:19:39.590
My vote

00:19:40.410 --> 00:19:41.670
represents my father.

00:19:42.350 --> 00:19:43.680
Actually, I can give up

00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:45.280
all the business interests.

00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:47.750
But I don't want to lose you.

00:19:50.550 --> 00:19:51.920
I want you to be safe.

00:19:53.030 --> 00:19:54.260
What they just said

00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:55.380
makes some sense.

00:19:55.510 --> 00:19:56.790
This is only temporary.

00:19:56.790 --> 00:19:58.200
It's not forever.

00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:01.160
Yuanzhi.

00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:03.590
I believe that someday,

00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:07.550
you will

00:20:08.270 --> 00:20:09.270
thank me for this.

00:20:40.510 --> 00:20:41.750
My father spent

00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:43.880
his entire life dedicated to research.

00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:45.400
Moma's genetic research

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:47.550
was more important to him than his life.

00:20:47.550 --> 00:20:48.440
I believe

00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:50.470
if he were here today,

00:20:50.490 --> 00:20:52.850
he would want
Moma Biotechnology's authority

00:20:52.850 --> 00:20:55.910
to be in the hands of someone
who understands research.

00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:57.030
Therefore,

00:20:57.750 --> 00:20:58.680
I vote for Mr. Mo.

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:13.590
The voting is over.

00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:14.680
But don't forget

00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:16.110
I also have a vote myself.

00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:17.590
If I'm not mistaken,

00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:19.510
whether by vote count or share percentage,

00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:22.550
I will continue to be in charge of Moma.

00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:27.170
I have an announcement.

00:21:27.270 --> 00:21:28.000
This morning,

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.350
I finalized the selection for

00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:32.680
the Assistant to the Chief Scientist
of the R&D Department.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:34.550
Who is it?

00:21:34.550 --> 00:21:35.240
Who is it?

00:21:35.970 --> 00:21:36.530
An Lan.

00:21:46.110 --> 00:21:47.000
See?

00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:49.030
Mo Yuanzhi

00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:51.160
just keeps appointing his own people.

00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:52.510
These researchers...

00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:54.060
Who knows what they're doing all day.

00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:56.110
An Lan has only been with
the company for a short while.

00:21:56.110 --> 00:21:58.920
Moma itself has only been established
for a few years.

00:21:58.920 --> 00:21:59.750
Let's not forget

00:21:59.750 --> 00:22:02.070
we are a biotech R&D company.

00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:04.160
Without the dedication
of our R&D Department,

00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:05.830
what would our future depend on?

00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:07.630
Today, I want you all to know that

00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:09.070
for Moma,

00:22:09.070 --> 00:22:10.790
the most valuable assets
will always be those

00:22:10.790 --> 00:22:12.720
who master our core technologies.

00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:17.170
So that's how the glass broke.

00:22:24.310 --> 00:22:25.970
According to company bylaws,

00:22:26.270 --> 00:22:28.110
I hereby officially appoint

00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:29.200
An Lan

00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:32.350
as Assistant to the Chief Scientist
of the R&D Department.

00:22:32.350 --> 00:22:34.310
Until a Chief Scientist is appointed,

00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:36.550
she will temporarily oversee
the R&D Department's daily operations.

00:22:36.550 --> 00:22:37.270
Mr. Mo,

00:22:37.870 --> 00:22:39.150
may I say a few words?

00:22:41.070 --> 00:22:42.720
Thank you to the company and Mr. Mo

00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:45.240
for entrusting me
with such an important position.

00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:47.680
I understand the significance of this role

00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:48.350
and I'm well aware

00:22:48.350 --> 00:22:49.880
that accepting this position

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:51.220
during this critical time

00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:52.440
means stepping up
in a challenging situation.

00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:53.550
Since I dare to accept it,

00:22:53.550 --> 00:22:54.510
I dare to take responsibility.

00:22:54.510 --> 00:22:55.640
I promise you

00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:57.960
that since Ms. Tang and Mr. Mo
haven't been afraid,

00:22:57.960 --> 00:22:59.620
then I won't be afraid either.

00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:01.350
I sincerely hope

00:23:01.350 --> 00:23:02.960
to gain everyone's support,

00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:05.440
so that Moma Group's research work

00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:06.900
can get back on track soon.

00:23:07.590 --> 00:23:08.590
I believe

00:23:09.470 --> 00:23:11.800
this is what
everyone wants to see as well.

00:23:16.830 --> 00:23:19.160
If no one has any other objections,

00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:20.690
we can conclude this topic.

00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:21.310
An Lan,

00:23:21.550 --> 00:23:23.240
go to the R&D Department
and make preparations.

00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:24.070
Regarding the position transfer,

00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:25.680
I'll have HR handle it
as soon as possible.

00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:26.240
Okay.

00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:32.710
I have nothing else to discuss.

00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:33.400
Then,

00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:34.510
meeting adjourned.

00:23:34.510 --> 00:23:35.170
Dismissed.

00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:42.550
Boss,

00:24:42.550 --> 00:24:43.110
there's a traffic jam ahead.

00:24:43.110 --> 00:24:44.570
We can't pass through now.

00:24:46.510 --> 00:24:47.680
We can't be late.

00:24:48.250 --> 00:24:49.160
Let's take another route.

00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:49.890
Got it, Boss.

00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:34.070
Around 11 o'clock today,

00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:35.510
someone tried to jump from

00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:36.590
the top floor of Yuehai Building,

00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:37.880
the tallest building
on Paris Middle Street.

00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:40.400
The jumper was in a standoff
with the police for hours,

00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:42.480
causing large-scale congestion.

00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:45.480
Currently, the jumper has been rescued
by the police.

00:26:16.830 --> 00:26:17.400
Hello.

00:26:17.790 --> 00:26:18.320
Hi there.

00:26:18.530 --> 00:26:19.460
Let's go inside.

00:26:20.030 --> 00:26:21.090
Let's talk inside.

00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:22.540
See you in a bit.

00:26:44.790 --> 00:26:45.510
You promised me

00:26:45.510 --> 00:26:46.830
that the shareholder meeting
would go perfectly,

00:26:46.830 --> 00:26:47.660
which is why I agreed to take the risk.

00:26:47.660 --> 00:26:48.720
But what happened?

00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:52.030
If you had worked with me,

00:26:52.030 --> 00:26:53.690
it would have been foolproof.

00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:04.880
I'm worried that Yuanzhi

00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:07.000
is getting suspicious of me.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.070
So what?

00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:10.000
If Mo Yuanzhi

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:11.350
doesn't let go of Moma,

00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:13.570
Squid will make a move against him.

00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:15.420
What's your relationship

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:16.920
with Moma?

00:27:20.110 --> 00:27:21.110
I used to work

00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:23.550
in their technical department.

00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:25.480
But three months ago,

00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:26.400
I quit.

00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:28.310
Do I still need to be questioned?

00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:29.830
I've already left the company.

00:27:29.830 --> 00:27:30.400
Well,

00:27:30.750 --> 00:27:32.750
what's your attitude toward them?

00:27:33.070 --> 00:27:33.920
Attitude?

00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:38.480
The power at Moma

00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:40.070
is in the hands of those researchers.

00:27:40.070 --> 00:27:41.270
How could it come down to us?

00:27:41.270 --> 00:27:42.030
That's why

00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:43.270
we need to figure out

00:27:43.270 --> 00:27:44.830
what exactly they're researching.

00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:46.760
I just went there to ask for my money

00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:48.590
and you brought me here instead.

00:27:48.590 --> 00:27:49.510
They owe me money.

00:27:49.510 --> 00:27:51.910
Is it wrong to ask
for what's mine, officer?

00:27:52.750 --> 00:27:54.610
Officer, I need to take this call.

00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:56.510
-It's a client.
-Sit down!

00:27:56.510 --> 00:27:56.960
The client is urging...

00:27:56.960 --> 00:27:57.510
Sit down!

00:28:06.740 --> 00:28:08.470
You wouldn't want your husband

00:28:09.530 --> 00:28:11.530
to end up like my father and Ms. Tang,

00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:14.170
and give up his life, would you?

00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:22.070
I'm just a delivery guy.

00:28:22.790 --> 00:28:24.590
I only make a few yuan per order,

00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:26.720
but if I'm late by a few minutes,

00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:28.520
I have to pay a 100-yuan penalty.

00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:29.790
A few minutes

00:28:29.790 --> 00:28:31.120
don't affect you at all.

00:28:31.550 --> 00:28:33.350
But people will still report me.

00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:34.680
One hundred yuan

00:28:35.030 --> 00:28:36.490
might not mean much to you,

00:28:36.550 --> 00:28:37.680
but 100 yuan

00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:40.270
is money for a whole day's worth of food
for my family,

00:28:40.270 --> 00:28:41.030
Officer.

00:28:44.790 --> 00:28:45.750
So,

00:28:45.750 --> 00:28:47.030
you hate Moma

00:28:47.050 --> 00:28:48.510
because they didn't pay you,

00:28:48.510 --> 00:28:50.140
so you want to
kill their CEO Mo Yuanzhi,

00:28:50.140 --> 00:28:50.700
right?

00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:55.270
Why would I kill anyone?

00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:56.920
Officer,

00:28:57.960 --> 00:28:59.240
I didn't do it!

00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:00.880
I need money.

00:29:01.550 --> 00:29:02.110
I went there

00:29:02.110 --> 00:29:03.200
to confront them.

00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:04.110
I went to Moma

00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:06.200
to make them give me the severance pay

00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:07.350
that I deserve!

00:29:07.350 --> 00:29:08.480
I just want them to give me the money.

00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:09.480
That's it!

00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:11.000
If he died, who would pay me?

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:11.830
I didn't do it.

00:29:12.350 --> 00:29:13.310
Don't wrongfully accuse me,

00:29:13.310 --> 00:29:14.110
Officer.

00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:18.590
Your delivery order has timed out.

00:29:42.290 --> 00:29:43.340
I'll say it again.

00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:44.980
If there's any danger,

00:29:46.750 --> 00:29:48.000
don't get others involved.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:49.510
I know why you agreed.

00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:52.030
If you protect me too well,

00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:53.930
Squid will never appear again.

00:29:54.750 --> 00:29:55.310
Then you'll have to

00:29:55.310 --> 00:29:56.770
keep guarding me forever.

00:29:57.440 --> 00:29:58.200
You and your team

00:29:58.200 --> 00:29:59.530
are already exhausted.

00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:00.960
To be honest,

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:05.060
I'm exhausted too.

00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:08.100
He's saying the same things
as in the previous loop.

00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:29.850
Hello, professors.

00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:31.310
Hello, students.

00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:33.590
I'm your student and alumnus,

00:30:33.590 --> 00:30:34.270
Mo Yuanzhi.

00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:43.070
Hello, Qi.

00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:44.440
That delivery guy

00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:45.550
didn't do anything.

00:30:45.550 --> 00:30:47.030
What basis did you arrest him on?

00:30:47.030 --> 00:30:48.560
You need to give me a reason.

00:30:55.210 --> 00:30:57.810
I really can't figure out
who's in charge here.

00:30:58.070 --> 00:31:00.200
You've probably seen the news lately.

00:31:00.550 --> 00:31:01.070
Yes.

00:31:02.110 --> 00:31:03.030
While my Moma Group

00:31:03.030 --> 00:31:04.350
has achieved some success,

00:31:04.350 --> 00:31:06.200
we've also offended many people.

00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:06.790
To be honest,

00:31:06.790 --> 00:31:08.470
it's a miracle that I'm standing here...

00:31:08.470 --> 00:31:09.640
Wang Haoxin, come up.

00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:11.170
With all four limbs intact.

00:31:11.830 --> 00:31:13.070
Just a few days ago,

00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:15.000
I received a death threat.

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:15.960
Keep an eye on Mo Yuanzhi.

00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:16.690
Understood.

00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:18.640
It wasn't some prank.

00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:20.780
It was a very formal death threat.

00:31:34.870 --> 00:31:36.310
[Ivy Bay University]

00:32:02.630 --> 00:32:05.310
[You Yuxiang]

00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:34.510
Mr. You.

00:32:35.790 --> 00:32:36.650
Yes, that's me.

00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:38.000
Who are you?

00:32:40.350 --> 00:32:41.350
May I look around?

00:32:42.830 --> 00:32:43.310
Come in.

00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:26.070
You seem interested in

00:33:26.070 --> 00:33:27.270
my clocks.

00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:30.500
Why are there so many clocks in this room?

00:33:33.030 --> 00:33:35.440
I just want to constantly remind myself

00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:37.200
how important time is.

00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:40.210
Have you heard of Lyubishchev?

00:33:41.310 --> 00:33:43.370
He was a famous Soviet entomologist.

00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:45.200
Lyubishchev.

00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:48.070
"A Strange Life."

00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:50.000
I've read his book.

00:33:56.110 --> 00:33:57.200
Like him,

00:33:57.200 --> 00:33:58.680
I'm also a biologist.

00:34:00.310 --> 00:34:01.920
But my control of time

00:34:02.790 --> 00:34:04.110
is far inferior to his.

00:34:05.590 --> 00:34:07.350
So how do you want to...

00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:09.360
How do you want to control time?

00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:09.920
Lyubishchev

00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:11.630
could very clearly record

00:34:11.630 --> 00:34:13.710
the time he spent on each activity,

00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:16.420
so he could cherish
every minute and second.

00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:18.280
Therefore, his time

00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:19.550
could be doubled.

00:34:20.510 --> 00:34:21.360
But I can't.

00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:22.960
Isn't that a pity?

00:34:23.190 --> 00:34:25.520
What's the benefit of doubling your time?

00:34:27.070 --> 00:34:28.840
With doubled time, you can do

00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:30.550
many meaningful things.

00:34:31.190 --> 00:34:31.790
Like what?

00:34:33.110 --> 00:34:34.230
Like...

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:43.710
I have to go.

00:34:46.110 --> 00:34:47.040
What do you want?

00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:51.030
Mr. You.

00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:54.360
A life for a life.

00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:56.760
Is it worth it?

00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:01.280
What do you mean?

00:35:17.070 --> 00:35:18.510
Suddenly, a huge squid

00:35:18.510 --> 00:35:19.670
appeared on my screen.

00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:21.130
It was very scary looking.

00:35:21.590 --> 00:35:22.920
It looked at me and said,

00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:25.800
"I'll kill you."

00:35:26.070 --> 00:35:27.070
I asked why.

00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:29.050
It replied, "Uh..."

00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:29.710
Then it was

00:35:29.710 --> 00:35:31.570
killed by my antivirus software.

00:36:07.510 --> 00:36:09.370
Why do you want to kill Mo Yuanzhi?

00:36:18.540 --> 00:36:19.100
Have we

00:36:19.470 --> 00:36:20.960
met somewhere before?

00:36:28.790 --> 00:36:29.590
Take him away.

00:36:48.630 --> 00:36:49.720
In this loop,

00:36:50.070 --> 00:36:51.800
I've already changed too much.

00:36:52.150 --> 00:36:52.800
But I must

00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:54.530
restrain Fu Jun and You Yuxiang

00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:56.120
to make the real Squid

00:36:56.310 --> 00:36:57.180
show itself.

00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:14.550
Who reported me?

00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:19.370
Nobody reported me, right?

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:24.800
Why aren't you saying anything?

00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:26.330
What is all this?

00:37:29.710 --> 00:37:30.150
Yes.

00:37:31.070 --> 00:37:31.710
I know.

00:37:32.190 --> 00:37:34.230
Many people oppose Moma.

00:37:34.230 --> 00:37:35.000
How are things outside?

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:36.460
And our genetic research.

00:37:36.510 --> 00:37:37.280
There was a small group

00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:39.000
of protesters with banners earlier.

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:39.960
They've all left now.

00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:42.590
They think we've violated
the laws of nature.

00:37:42.590 --> 00:37:43.760
Can someone explain to me

00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:45.290
what the laws of nature are?

00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:46.550
The sun sets

00:37:47.030 --> 00:37:47.840
and it gets dark.

00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:49.110
So naturally, we should go to sleep,

00:37:49.110 --> 00:37:49.630
right?

00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:51.520
Then why did we invent lights

00:37:51.800 --> 00:37:52.440
and the TV?

00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:53.670
Why do we stay up late?

00:37:53.960 --> 00:37:55.220
How unnatural is that?

00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:56.070
The sun rises

00:37:56.070 --> 00:37:56.960
and it gets bright.

00:37:56.960 --> 00:37:58.280
So naturally, we should get up,

00:37:58.280 --> 00:37:58.960
right?

00:38:00.510 --> 00:38:00.960
Right?

00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:01.960
Is my lecture boring?

00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:02.630
Look at you.

00:38:03.070 --> 00:38:04.590
I stayed up late last night.

00:38:04.590 --> 00:38:05.520
What did you say?

00:38:05.710 --> 00:38:07.000
You stayed up late last night?

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:08.030
Are you crazy?

00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:09.480
Do you not want to be natural?

00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:10.440
You're not following the law,

00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:10.920
are you?

00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:14.710
Is that so?

00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:29.040
Boss.

00:38:29.070 --> 00:38:29.670
Qi,

00:38:30.150 --> 00:38:31.510
the delivery guy

00:38:31.510 --> 00:38:32.110
really doesn't have

00:38:32.110 --> 00:38:33.770
any motive to kill Mo Yuanzhi.

00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:35.000
I've checked all of his

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:35.670
chat history.

00:38:35.670 --> 00:38:36.870
Nothing suspicious.

00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:39.440
As for Professor You Yuxiang?

00:38:39.630 --> 00:38:42.620
Even though the syringe in his hand
contained poison,

00:38:42.620 --> 00:38:44.950
it doesn't prove he's guilty.

00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:51.510
Can you stall for another half hour,

00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:53.340
just to be safe?

00:38:54.110 --> 00:38:55.040
Stall some more?

00:38:55.510 --> 00:38:56.510
I'll say it again.

00:38:56.760 --> 00:38:57.690
Give me a reason.

00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:05.480
Young people these days are so rude.

00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:08.800
Do I really owe him my life?

00:39:14.150 --> 00:39:15.190
A life for a life.

00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:17.200
Is it worth it?

00:39:23.670 --> 00:39:24.480
It's worth it.

00:39:30.110 --> 00:39:31.400
You have no evidence.

00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:33.290
You should let me go now.

00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:37.230
Why?

00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:39.960
Because in today's state
of tech advancement,

00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:40.630
why should we

00:39:40.630 --> 00:39:42.280
give the right of
deciding our life and death

00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:43.360
to nature?

00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:45.220
It doesn't make sense!

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:51.320
The reason why humans can

00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:52.920
continue to develop and progress

00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:54.400
generation after generation

00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:55.030
is because

00:39:55.030 --> 00:39:57.080
we keep defying nature.

00:39:57.080 --> 00:39:57.670
[Kai, bring a few people
to the cake shop.]

00:39:57.670 --> 00:39:58.360
Okay.

00:39:58.360 --> 00:39:59.190
Someone must think

00:39:59.190 --> 00:39:59.250
that the phrase "defying nature"

00:39:59.250 --> 00:40:00.360
[Got it]

00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:01.710
sounds somewhat sacrilegious.

00:40:01.710 --> 00:40:02.630
It doesn't matter.

00:40:02.630 --> 00:40:03.760
Let me and my team...

00:40:04.070 --> 00:40:04.800
Wang Haoxin,

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:05.510
come up here.

00:40:05.510 --> 00:40:07.030
We'll take the blame.

00:40:07.370 --> 00:40:08.040
I just hope

00:40:08.070 --> 00:40:09.510
that when we succeed,

00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:10.920
each one of us

00:40:11.070 --> 00:40:12.280
can enjoy this technological era.

00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:13.320
Keep an eye on Mo Yuanzhi

00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:14.800
and take him back when it's over.

00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:15.530
Understood.

00:40:15.910 --> 00:40:17.980
If this is considered a sacrilege,

00:40:18.030 --> 00:40:20.280
then I, Mo Yuanzhi, am sacrilegious.

00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:21.070
So what?

00:40:21.230 --> 00:40:22.110
Bravo!

00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:25.400
Nice!

00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:31.280
Fang Lu.

00:40:31.510 --> 00:40:33.260
What did Tang Xin do this morning?

00:40:33.260 --> 00:40:35.840
She was in the experiment area
most of the time.

00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:36.840
I couldn't get in.

00:40:36.860 --> 00:40:39.190
Now she's having coffee with colleagues.

00:40:39.710 --> 00:40:41.070
What are they talking about?

00:40:41.070 --> 00:40:42.670
Just typical girl talk.

00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:44.030
They seem to be discussing

00:40:44.030 --> 00:40:44.880
what to wear

00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:47.010
to the Zhao family's wedding tonight.

00:40:47.070 --> 00:40:48.150
Who is she with?

00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:50.510
I think it's someone called

00:40:50.510 --> 00:40:52.840
An Lan, Assistant to the Chief Scientist.

00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:54.920
What?

00:40:55.290 --> 00:40:57.000
Is she also attending
the Zhao family's wedding?

00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:58.230
Not just her.

00:40:58.230 --> 00:40:58.800
I heard

00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:00.800
all of Moma's executives are going.

00:41:05.630 --> 00:41:06.510
Keep a close eye on An Lan.

00:41:06.510 --> 00:41:08.240
Don't let her out of your sight.

00:41:08.550 --> 00:41:09.190
Watch her?

00:41:10.150 --> 00:41:11.000
She

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:12.840
just took over Tang Shaorong's position.

00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:14.280
She might have become

00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:15.150
Squid's target now.

00:41:15.150 --> 00:41:16.320
Watch her carefully.

00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:17.050
Understood.

00:41:18.070 --> 00:41:19.510
Who exactly is Squid?

00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:21.280
Why are there so many changes?
