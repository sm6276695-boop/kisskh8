in school.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:25.550
I've been following

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:27.150
your research all this time.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.130
At this round of interviews,

if I say

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:31.870
I'll give you the highest standard

of employee benefits and subsidies,

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.260
will you join us?

Also a fellow alumnus.

I'm here

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.530
because I'm interested in
Moma's RAN Project.

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:47.920
I don't want to hide anything.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.240
My mother had a car accident last year.

She's still in a vegetative state.

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:53.320

RAN's future development

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.130
will include gene-based drugs
for neuronal repair.

Ms. Cai.

00:14:26.050 --> 00:14:29.000
I signed the resignation agreement
three months ago.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:30.870
But I still haven't received
the compensation.

00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:32.320

that you violated the rules.

00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:40.310
We can't pay the compensation for now.

00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:42.170
I didn't break the rules, Ms. Cai.

00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:45.780
Then I'll go to Mr. Mo!

00:14:45.970 --> 00:14:46.670

I haven't achieved much success,

00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:37.960
They're free to go up to the mountains

00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:39.510
and go down to the seas.

00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:40.200
They can

00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:42.160
go back to the nature they extol.

00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:43.160
And we will

00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:45.790
continue to challenge the laws of nature.

00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:46.680
Why?

00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:49.440
Because in today's state
of tech advancement,

00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:50.110
why should we

00:25:50.110 --> 00:25:51.880
give the right of
deciding our life and death

00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:52.960
to nature?

00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:54.700
It doesn't make sense!

00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:00.270
The reason we humans can keep improving

00:26:00.270 --> 00:26:01.000
for generations

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.440
is because we keep going against fate.

00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:04.160
Okay.

00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:05.160
Someone must think

00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:06.000
that the notion of

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.640
going against fate sounds sacrilegious.

00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:08.640
It doesn't matter.

00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:09.680
Let me and my team

00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:11.350
do this sacrilegious deed.

00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:12.920
We'll take the blame.

00:26:13.030 --> 00:26:13.750
I just hope

00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:15.110
that when we succeed,

00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:16.070
all of us

00:26:16.070 --> 00:26:17.160
can experience,

00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:18.640
feel, and receive

00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:19.920
the medical benefits

00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:21.350
in this technological era!

00:26:21.350 --> 00:26:22.070
If...

00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:23.480
If...

00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:26.350
this is considered a sacrilege,

00:26:26.350 --> 00:26:28.510
then I, Mo Yuanzhi, am sacrilegious.

00:26:28.510 --> 00:26:29.400
So what?

00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:31.160
Bravo!

00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:33.200
Nice!

00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:48.440
Kai.

00:26:49.230 --> 00:26:50.320
Watch the girl

00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:51.340
with the bouquet.

00:27:01.060 --> 00:27:02.260
Genetic engineering

00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:03.700
is going against fate.

00:27:04.110 --> 00:27:05.880
I believe our RAN technology

00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:08.080
will someday help you

00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:09.160
and all of humanity

00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:10.350
to go against fate.

00:27:10.350 --> 00:27:11.480
Flowers from the school council.

00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:12.160
Thank you.

00:27:12.750 --> 00:27:14.960
This has been your student and alumnus,

00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:15.750
Mo Yuanzhi.

00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:19.160
Bravo!

00:27:28.030 --> 00:27:28.920
Dr. Mo.

00:27:29.130 --> 00:27:30.130
These are for you.

00:27:30.310 --> 00:27:31.000
Thank you.

00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:47.930
Kai!

00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:04.550
I just want an autograph.

00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:11.160
I'm sorry.

00:28:11.430 --> 00:28:12.190
It's okay.

00:28:12.270 --> 00:28:12.790
Are you okay?

00:28:12.790 --> 00:28:13.400
Yes.

00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:14.790
Let me sign it for you.

00:28:20.550 --> 00:28:21.240
Sorry.

00:28:21.590 --> 00:28:22.400
Thank you.

00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:23.110
Thank you.

00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:24.270
This way.

00:28:24.590 --> 00:28:25.400
Sorry.

00:28:32.050 --> 00:28:33.860
This little episode

00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:35.070
truly showed

00:28:35.070 --> 00:28:36.610
how popular

00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:38.050
Dr. Mo really is.

00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:39.170
Alright.

00:28:39.380 --> 00:28:41.690
Now, it's time for the Q&A.

00:28:42.170 --> 00:28:43.990
Not just limited to academic questions,

00:28:43.990 --> 00:28:45.240
feel free to ask anything

00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:46.070
you want.

00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:47.470
Alright,

00:28:47.590 --> 00:28:48.680
let's get started.

00:28:52.510 --> 00:28:54.170
That male student over there.

00:28:54.510 --> 00:28:54.960
Yes.

00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:02.350
Hello, Dr. Mo.

00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:05.000
As RAN technology develops,

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:06.880
will there be more and more diseases

00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:08.470
that can be cured through it?

00:29:08.470 --> 00:29:09.510
In that case,

00:29:09.530 --> 00:29:12.530
will traditional pharmaceutical factories
go bust?

00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:15.160
Thank you for

00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:16.350
your astute question.

00:29:16.350 --> 00:29:17.010
Please sit.

00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:20.310
Actually, I really hope RAN technology

00:29:20.310 --> 00:29:21.750
will make greater contributions

00:29:21.750 --> 00:29:22.920
for mankind in the future.

00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:24.510
This has always been a prime goal

00:29:24.510 --> 00:29:25.350
of Moma.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:27.030
As for your second question,

00:29:27.030 --> 00:29:28.290
I've thought about it.

00:29:28.350 --> 00:29:29.030
In the future,

00:29:29.030 --> 00:29:31.240
there might be
better and more novel technology

00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:32.640
replacing RAN.

00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:33.790
It's not a bad thing.

00:29:34.350 --> 00:29:35.110
Being replaced

00:29:35.110 --> 00:29:37.000
is a concern of every business.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:38.480
Not being replaced is

00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:40.610
the motivation for Moma to keep going.

00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:47.280
That female student there.

00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:51.030
Hello, Dr. Mo.

00:29:51.030 --> 00:29:52.750
I'm a sophomore.

00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:53.590
If I'm interested

00:29:53.590 --> 00:29:55.160
in joining Moma after graduation,

00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:57.090
what's the most important factor?

00:29:58.070 --> 00:30:00.550
The most important factor is that...

00:30:00.550 --> 00:30:01.790
when you graduate in two years,

00:30:01.790 --> 00:30:03.240
Moma hasn't gone bust.

00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:06.790
We value three qualities

00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:07.950
when hiring:

00:30:08.070 --> 00:30:08.800
confidence,

00:30:09.030 --> 00:30:09.720
honesty,

00:30:10.070 --> 00:30:11.070
and persistence.

00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:12.350
I believe these are

00:30:12.350 --> 00:30:14.080
also the qualities of science.

00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:17.160
Let's barge in.

00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:17.750
Go inside!

00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:18.720
Hurry! Go in!

00:30:23.350 --> 00:30:24.110
Mo Yuanzhi!

00:30:24.130 --> 00:30:25.650
Get out, Mo Yuanzhi!

00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:41.120
Boycott Mo Yuanzhi!

00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:44.970
Is this what you want?

00:30:46.210 --> 00:30:47.440
Protect human genes!

00:30:47.530 --> 00:30:49.190
Boycott Moma Biotechnology!

00:30:55.830 --> 00:30:56.480
Kai!

00:30:56.480 --> 00:30:57.270
Call the car over!

00:30:57.270 --> 00:30:57.880
Roger!

00:30:58.590 --> 00:30:59.440
Sorry!

00:30:59.790 --> 00:31:00.420
Yuanzhi.

00:31:00.870 --> 00:31:03.130
It's our fault. Our security was too lax.

00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:05.270
Step back!

00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:06.540
Back off! Back off!

00:31:06.670 --> 00:31:07.990
Back off!

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:10.830
Back off!

00:31:11.270 --> 00:31:12.480
Calm down!

00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:16.650
Silence! Everyone, step back!

00:31:17.510 --> 00:31:18.880
Back off! Silence!

00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:24.830
Mr. Mo! Mr. Mo!

00:31:27.750 --> 00:31:28.350
Freeze!

00:31:30.550 --> 00:31:31.350
Mr. Mo!

00:31:31.470 --> 00:31:33.460
Is it wrong for me to get my money back?

00:31:33.460 --> 00:31:34.670
Let go of me!

00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:04.200
Freeze!

00:32:09.130 --> 00:32:10.130
Step back!

00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:13.900
[Boycott Moma Biotechnology]

00:32:19.450 --> 00:32:20.450
Freeze!

00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:54.520
Thank you.

00:32:55.100 --> 00:32:55.730
Thank you.

00:32:56.680 --> 00:32:57.400
Thank you.

00:32:57.750 --> 00:32:58.950
Mr. Mo, please get in.

00:33:15.270 --> 00:33:16.350
Follow Mo Yuanzhi.

00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:18.070
I'll interrogate those two.

00:33:18.070 --> 00:33:18.590
Leave it to us.

00:33:18.590 --> 00:33:19.310
Yes, Boss.

00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:23.530
Yay, I caught the Squid.

00:33:23.770 --> 00:33:25.050
Boss caught him, no?

00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:26.800
I mean I handcuffed him.

00:33:26.820 --> 00:33:28.080
You get some merit too.

00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:30.170
Stop bragging and get a move on.

00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:31.000
What's the hurry?

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:31.880
Squid has been caught.

00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:32.750
Relax.

00:33:43.510 --> 00:33:44.270
Based on initial analysis,

00:33:44.270 --> 00:33:45.970
the liquid in the syringe is a neurotoxin.

00:33:45.970 --> 00:33:48.310
The injected will soon
die of organ failure.

00:33:48.310 --> 00:33:49.960
This is an experimental drug

00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:51.290
from You Yuxiang's lab.

00:34:09.070 --> 00:34:09.960
You Yuxiang,

00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:12.630
a lab researcher
and former associate professor

00:34:12.630 --> 00:34:13.960
at Ivy Bay University.

00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:14.880
You were stripped of

00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:16.070
your professorship

00:34:16.070 --> 00:34:17.320
after being reported

00:34:18.110 --> 00:34:21.040
for attacking others online
due to academic issues.

00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:25.250
Long time no see.

00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:31.510
Congratulations, Mr. Zhao.

00:34:31.510 --> 00:34:32.570
Congratulations.

00:34:34.230 --> 00:34:34.760
Long time no see.

00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:35.400
Yes.

00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:36.550
Hello.

00:34:37.030 --> 00:34:37.960
Congratulations.

00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:38.880
Welcome.

00:34:41.710 --> 00:34:42.510
You're Fu Jun,

00:34:42.510 --> 00:34:44.150
a former Moma technician

00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:45.670
fired three months ago,

00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:48.630
and you've yet to receive compensation.

00:34:48.630 --> 00:34:49.230
Right?

00:34:50.989 --> 00:34:51.590
Yes.

00:34:52.510 --> 00:34:53.440
I hate them.

00:34:54.590 --> 00:34:55.670
I hate their company

00:34:55.670 --> 00:34:57.130
and their top management.

00:34:57.300 --> 00:34:58.230
A group of people

00:34:58.710 --> 00:35:00.710
under the cloak of being scientists

00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:03.110
when they're actually
bloodsucking profiteers.

00:35:03.110 --> 00:35:04.440
I abhor them.

00:35:07.070 --> 00:35:08.930
Why do you want to kill Mo Yuanzhi?

00:35:10.110 --> 00:35:10.840
What?

00:35:11.230 --> 00:35:12.070
Kill him?

00:35:12.510 --> 00:35:13.440
That's not true.

00:35:14.110 --> 00:35:15.770
What do you mean? What murder?

00:35:16.230 --> 00:35:18.070
I was taking a syringe to the lab.

00:35:18.070 --> 00:35:19.470
The crowd squeezed me in.

00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:19.960
Once I was in,

00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:22.420
-you pressed me to the ground.
-You Yuxiang!

00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:26.320
We have the witness and evidence.

00:35:27.450 --> 00:35:29.250
Saying all this is meaningless.

00:35:30.130 --> 00:35:33.460
Did you think no one would find out
if you killed in the chaos?

00:35:37.550 --> 00:35:38.280
Fine.

00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:40.550
Sure. Okay.

00:35:40.550 --> 00:35:41.360
Convict me.

00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:42.100
Sentence me.

00:35:42.130 --> 00:35:43.670
F-Finish the procedure.

00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:45.480
I'm not afraid of anything.

00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:48.840
Did you organize that student protest too?

00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:50.840
They didn't go against the law.

00:35:51.690 --> 00:35:53.480
They followed my instructions.

00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:55.080
Kill me or ruin me as you wish.

00:35:55.840 --> 00:35:56.970
Leave them out of it.

00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:06.240
What did you want?

00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:07.130
Your salary?

00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:07.950
Officer,

00:36:08.430 --> 00:36:09.880
I was at my wit's end.

00:36:10.530 --> 00:36:11.820
I went to HR,

00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:13.350
but they ignored me.

00:36:13.350 --> 00:36:14.810
So I could only go to Mr. Mo.

00:36:15.020 --> 00:36:16.870
I can no longer pay my mortgage.

00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:18.760
My whole family depends on me.

00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:20.020
I'm completely broke.

00:36:31.690 --> 00:36:34.090
How many times
did you simulate the murders

00:36:35.030 --> 00:36:36.690
of Han Song and Tang Shaorong?

00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:44.760
Why did you

00:36:45.590 --> 00:36:47.320
switch to such a direct method?

00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:48.480
Why?

00:36:49.880 --> 00:36:51.030
Why today?

00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:07.860
When Tang Shaorong and Han Song died,

00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:09.280
You Yuxiang wasn't in Hua'ao.

00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:10.880
He does have an alibi.

00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:11.400
Also,

00:37:11.550 --> 00:37:12.630
in his house and office,

00:37:12.630 --> 00:37:15.490
there's no residual reaction
from any explosives.

00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:27.430
Kai.

00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:28.430
Kai!

00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:29.920
What's wrong, Boss?

00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:31.150
Neither of them is Squid.

00:37:31.150 --> 00:37:32.150
All of you,

00:37:32.150 --> 00:37:33.280
protect Mo Yuanzhi!

00:37:35.710 --> 00:37:36.320
Roger.

00:37:36.510 --> 00:37:37.070
Roger.

00:37:37.710 --> 00:37:38.540
This morning,

00:37:38.630 --> 00:37:40.320
celebrity Fang Zhou appeared in a cafe

00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:41.440
and was surrounded by fans,

00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:42.630
resulting in a stampede.

00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:45.030
The injured have been
sent to the hospital.

00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:54.030
Next,

00:37:54.030 --> 00:37:55.360
let's welcome the newlyweds

00:37:55.360 --> 00:37:56.840
to share their sweet happiness

00:37:56.840 --> 00:37:58.880
with every one of the guests here.

00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:00.360
Bride and groom, please.

00:38:06.070 --> 00:38:06.710
I'm here.

00:38:06.710 --> 00:38:07.510
Where are you?

00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:08.480
On the lawn.

00:38:08.510 --> 00:38:09.400
Where is Mo Yuanzhi?

00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:10.230
With us.

00:38:42.420 --> 00:38:43.420
Kai!

00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:46.590
Kai!

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:52.880
Kai.

00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:55.070
Kai!

00:38:57.430 --> 00:38:58.360
Fang Lu.

00:39:00.190 --> 00:39:01.510
Fang Lu!

00:40:23.890 --> 00:40:25.090
Please wait outside.

00:40:28.170 --> 00:40:28.800
Sorry.

00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:29.590
Only staff allowed.

00:40:29.590 --> 00:40:30.850
You can't go in, sorry.

00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:27.810
Do you regret it?

00:41:30.370 --> 00:41:31.690
I told you not to come.

00:41:37.110 --> 00:41:38.110
You're the one...

00:41:38.900 --> 00:41:40.900
who insisted on bringing them here!

00:41:44.420 --> 00:41:46.220
Why did you accept this mission?

00:41:51.840 --> 00:41:52.510
Kai...

00:41:55.230 --> 00:41:56.550
He is an only son.

00:41:57.260 --> 00:42:00.190
His 70-year-old parents are
waiting at home for him.

00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:01.770
Fang Lu

00:42:02.680 --> 00:42:05.010
joined our team less than three years ago.

00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:06.780
She's inexperienced.

00:42:07.510 --> 00:42:08.680
I told you

00:42:09.030 --> 00:42:10.550
to take good care of them.

00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:12.360
But what have you done?

00:42:20.070 --> 00:42:22.030
How will you explain to their families?

00:42:22.030 --> 00:42:24.400
How will you explain to them?

00:42:30.630 --> 00:42:31.630
Let go of me!

00:42:33.190 --> 00:42:35.480
How will you explain to their families?

00:42:36.820 --> 00:42:38.340
Reflect on yourself!

00:43:09.640 --> 00:43:10.840
The day's been reset.

00:43:11.400 --> 00:43:12.760
It's a loop day today.
