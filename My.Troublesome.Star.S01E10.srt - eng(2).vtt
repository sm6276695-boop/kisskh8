00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:05.380
(Year 1999)

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:07.550
(Police)

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:14.950
(Uhm Jung Hwa)

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:20.429
(Song Seung Heon)

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.760
(EL, Oh Dae Hwan)

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.300
(Cha Chung Hwa, Hyun Bong Sik, Jo Yeon Hee)

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.880
(My Troublesome Star)

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:39.409
(Production Sponsors)

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:40.879
(Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism and KOCCA)

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:41.880
(All people, incidents, and backgrounds...)

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:42.880
(in this drama are fictitious and unrelated to reality.)

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:43.880
(Also, children were filmed under production guidelines.)

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:54.590
It's me. I'm here.

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.600
- Where are you? - At your place.

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.830
Wait, you're here? But why?

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.300
Well, you got hurt helping me. How could I just ignore it?

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:06.299
I may not be able to treat you,

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.069
but I can at least make you porridge.

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.809
I'm telling you I'm fine. Okay?

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:12.110
Open the door.

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.450
What? Oh, you're already here?

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.179
I'm right outside your door! Hurry up!

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.280
This is heavy.

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.849
Just a minute! Wait! Hold on! Just a second!

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.920
You must be in too much pain to even move.

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.789
All right, just tell me the code. You just stay put.

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:29.859
I'll let myself in.

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.599
No, that's not it. It's just...

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.230
Hurry up. This is heavy.

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.409
Okay, it's 0728.

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:42.140
- I'll be right out. - Hello?

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:45.640
So 0728...

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.260
I dedicate this award to 0728,

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:05.730
who gave me great strength and courage...

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:07.870
when I was struggling.

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:11.969
The pork gukbap from Busan has the deepest broth.

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.039
The broth should be clear.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.739
You need to add only a bit of salted shrimps.

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.040
You season it with salted shrimp. Here, let me.

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:21.310
Isn't Busan your hometown?

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:24.750
How did you know?

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.890
To all the people expecting the old Lim Se Ra,

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:33.320
the way I am now must be such a disappointment.

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.460
Back then and now, you seem the same to me.

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.770
I'm just glad you're safe. I mean it.

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.600
(Open)

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:59.880
I told you I'm okay.

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:09.890
What's wrong?

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:15.730
It's nothing.

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:34.910
Oh, come in. My goodness, what is all this?

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:36.410
Here, let me get that.

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:38.280
Come on in.

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.970
My type is a moderately masculine build,

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:59.540
and intense eyes that seem to look only at me.

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:02.240
With an honest voice...

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:06.779
He had absolutely no clue how to dress.

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:09.310
And his face was so tanned as if it were stained with dirt.

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:13.320
If I were that detective, I wouldn't like Lim Se Ra.

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:17.959
You kept putting down the rookie detective.

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.729
So what if I praise or critique him?

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:22.529
What's it to you, Detective?

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:24.930
Come on, it does concern me.

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:27.900
I mean, the thing is...

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:31.700
Don't tell me you've been pretending all this time?

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:36.239
Gosh. How long has it been since I've been to Busan?

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:39.040
Are you talking about that police station in Busan you mentioned?

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:42.610
You had so many chances to tell me the truth,

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:44.650
and you played dumb all this time?

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:46.650
No one's looking.

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:53.190
What is all this stuff?

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:54.690
Gosh.

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:07.370
People who live alone don't eat properly.

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:09.570
And you're sick, on top of that.

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:12.080
Do you even know how to cook?

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:14.579
Gosh! What's this?

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:18.879
What's your problem with hospitals? If you're sick, you see a doctor.

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:20.490
Why are you treating it yourself? Honestly...

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:21.920
Eel.

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:26.359
Gosh, I thought it was a snake. Anyway, I use first-aid medicine.

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:27.559
And I'm fine after a good night's sleep.

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:30.630
That's how you get a chronic injury. What, you think you're still young?

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.200
You think you're as spry as you used to be?

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:38.570
People think I'm in my 30s. I even get carded sometimes.

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:44.740
Look at you lying with a straight face.

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:49.280
Are you always such a good liar?

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:52.420
What? When have I ever lied to you?

00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:58.360
There's really nothing?

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:03.390
Nothing you've hidden or lied about?

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:09.370
Well...

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:12.170
I don't think so.

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:18.840
Remember that detective I told you about?

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:22.080
The rookie detective with the accent who had no style.

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:29.890
Oh, you mean that guy from back in Busan?

00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:32.720
The way you described him. How could I forget that?

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:38.100
His looks left a bit to be desired, but he was a good person inside.

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:39.430
"Left a bit to be desired?"

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:43.070
Oh, I see.

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:46.400
So what was so great about him on the inside?

00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:50.370
He doesn't spin a yarn.

00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:55.879
What kind of actress uses language like that?

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:57.049
Oh, forget it. Just go.

00:07:57.050 --> 00:07:58.950
I need to cook. Hurry up and go.

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:14.230
But it's just an indulgence that's not worth the money.

00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:16.330
Exactly.

00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:19.270
Do you know who she's marrying?

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:22.040
We have to get married earlier.

00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:24.110
So what?

00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:26.510
Oh, so you're a "dating expert" now, not a "dating coach?"

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:29.980
What does that even mean to you?

00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:31.220
What meaning?

00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:34.120
You can't throw that...

00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:43.490
Gosh!

00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:45.500
I know you live alone, but still.

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:47.530
What on earth have you been living on?

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:48.930
I live on dew.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.260
It's all ready. Come and eat.

00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:52.330
You could have at least told me.

00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:56.930
Seeing you get hurt and heartbroken...

00:09:57.840 --> 00:09:59.000
I couldn't stand to watch it anymore.

00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:04.080
As your true manager, I'd always be here for you.

00:10:05.710 --> 00:10:08.780
So from now on, regarding Lim Se Ra, you go through me.

00:10:09.850 --> 00:10:11.420
- Let's do it! - Let's do it!

00:10:21.390 --> 00:10:23.590
And I didn't even realize he was right here beside me.

00:11:16.810 --> 00:11:17.820
Excuse me.

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:21.920
The food you left out in the kitchen for us to share...

00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:23.620
I really enjoyed it.

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:25.860
(This food is for you. Enjoy. Bong Chung Ja, Unit 406)

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:31.730
I'm glad you enjoyed it.

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:36.170
It's just that I can't rest easy after a free meal.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.440
Oh, my goodness. That feels so good. This is amazing.

00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:48.350
You have a hidden talent.

00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:50.850
You have to learn whatever you can to get by.

00:11:53.250 --> 00:11:54.650
Why live in a place like this?

00:11:55.490 --> 00:11:57.290
Why do you live in a place like this, then?

00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:05.130
You seem so young. Did you graduate from school?

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.800
I dropped out and got my GED.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.000
I see.

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:13.040
Who cares about background nowadays, anyway?

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:17.710
I heard you used to be a super famous actress.

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:20.080
What, I don't look the part?

00:12:20.850 --> 00:12:22.250
When I give massages,

00:12:23.010 --> 00:12:26.850
sometimes I can sense someone's life through my fingertips.

00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:28.790
How is mine?

00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:32.720
- You haven't lived a pampered life. - Gosh.

00:12:35.830 --> 00:12:37.600
You've got skillful hands.

00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:43.330
I was worried you might have drugged it,

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:47.100
but it was actually quite delicious.

00:12:47.370 --> 00:12:48.370
What on earth?

00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:49.840
Do you think I'm crazy?

00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:52.279
Why would I drug someone's food?

00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:54.580
No, it's just that... I saw you in the kitchen before...

00:12:56.580 --> 00:12:57.580
Before?

00:12:58.680 --> 00:12:59.749
Never mind.

00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:01.550
What? Why are you stopping mid-sentence?

00:13:01.790 --> 00:13:02.890
What is it?

00:13:03.950 --> 00:13:05.420
Come on, what is it?

00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:06.920
Hey.

00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:13.629
- Hey, I said stop filming! - Ms. Lim Se Ra!

00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:14.700
Seriously!

00:13:14.970 --> 00:13:17.129
Get out of here before I report you for trespassing.

00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:19.600
This is all being broadcast. Watch your mouth.

00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:21.769
What is all this?

00:13:21.770 --> 00:13:26.609
Look, I asked for her manager but got no reply, so I came myself.

00:13:26.610 --> 00:13:30.309
You all saw on TV that I live here. What more do you want to film?

00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:34.520
The public is eager to hear your story of how you ended up here.

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:36.849
What do you mean, "here?" What's wrong with this place?

00:13:36.850 --> 00:13:38.090
What do you mean, "here?"

00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:41.230
Or is it just you who's curious, Mr. Reporter?

00:13:41.390 --> 00:13:44.800
Why so determined to keep quiet? Are you hiding something?

00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:46.360
That's...

00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:52.840
For now, I'm focusing on my project. I'll reveal everything after that.

00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:56.669
I'll even give you the exclusive. Deal?

00:13:56.670 --> 00:13:59.640
I feel like a bigger story will break before then.

00:14:02.010 --> 00:14:03.150
"Bigger?" What do you mean?

00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:14.230
Gosh.

00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:23.870
Anyone home?

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:28.510
I guess she's gone. Oh, well.

00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:42.050
Eat every last bite and get better soon.

00:14:42.450 --> 00:14:45.560
And don't you dare get me sick.

00:14:55.730 --> 00:14:58.439
Actress Lim Se Ra, making her comeback after 25 years,

00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:01.640
is now rumored to be dating global Korean star, Won Ban.

00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:05.939
On an online forum, photos of Won Ban and Bong Chung Ja...

00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:09.449
being very affectionate on set have been posted...

00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:10.950
and have since gone viral.

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:14.590
What do you mean you won't issue a statement denying the rumors?

00:15:15.390 --> 00:15:16.819
(Won Ban and Lim Se Ra's Pink Romance)

00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:21.260
Gosh. It means we won't confirm or deny.

00:15:21.890 --> 00:15:24.359
You need to officially state that the rumors are unfounded.

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:25.729
That there's nothing going on between us.

00:15:25.730 --> 00:15:27.670
And what would be the point of that?

00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:31.270
- What? - Think about it.

00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:32.870
This is Won Ban we're talking about.

00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:36.240
An A-lister for nearly 30 years. A global superstar.

00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:39.609
What do you possibly have to lose by being linked to him?

00:15:39.610 --> 00:15:42.410
- I don't want this. - What if his people say it's fine?

00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:44.480
Don't tell me...

00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:48.720
Did you plant this story?

00:15:54.330 --> 00:15:58.829
So all this "second prime" talk was a ploy to get me to do this?

00:15:58.830 --> 00:16:00.830
Let's be blunt. You're yesterday's news.

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:05.739
Young people don't care about you. But Won Ban is a different story.

00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:07.400
He's still bankable.

00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:12.139
So you want me to ride his coattails to generate some buzz?

00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:15.110
There we go. Now we're talking. Come on, high five!

00:16:16.250 --> 00:16:17.310
Yes?

00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:23.349
Oh, perfect timing. You told the press, "No comment."

00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:24.560
And you spread that around, right?

00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:30.730
"The two are absolutely not dating." I issued an official denial.

00:16:31.530 --> 00:16:33.700
What? You punk.

00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:37.629
I told you exactly what to do! To subtly hint that they're dating.

00:16:37.630 --> 00:16:39.169
Why did you go do your own thing? Darn it!

00:16:39.170 --> 00:16:40.200
Hey, Kang Du Won!

00:16:41.770 --> 00:16:44.010
You lay one finger on my manager.

00:16:53.150 --> 00:16:58.320
Look, why not use this opportunity and start dating Won Ban for real?

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:01.459
You've lost your mind!

00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:05.400
Why not? It seems Won Ban still likes you.

00:17:05.860 --> 00:17:07.059
Hey, Kang Du Won!

00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:08.930
You're not exactly in a position to say no.

00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:11.069
I mean, honestly, in your position,

00:17:11.070 --> 00:17:13.439
with absolutely nothing to your name,

00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:14.509
you should be on your knees,

00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:16.240
thanking him for even looking at you.

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:20.439
Gosh, you're in this pathetic state, and you still can't grasp reality.

00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:23.550
You don't even know your place. Darn it.

00:17:24.820 --> 00:17:25.950
Watch your mouth.

00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:32.790
What has gotten into you today?

00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:48.340
I was kidding. Your look could kill.

00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:49.940
Gosh, so scary.

00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:53.680
This is just ridiculous.

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:07.930
Thanks.

00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:11.860
Let's go.

00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:25.210
Well, look at that. The punk's got some nerve.

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:28.710
Why was I intimidated? Unbelievable.

00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:31.750
Gosh. That had me on pins and needles.

00:18:41.230 --> 00:18:44.030
Do you have a grudge against Mr. Kang I don't know about?

00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:50.830
Gosh, Detective. I've never seen you so angry before.

00:18:56.270 --> 00:18:57.270
An actress?

00:18:57.610 --> 00:19:01.010
The management agency that brokered the deal was Lim Se Ra's.

00:19:02.310 --> 00:19:04.750
(Kang Du Won)

00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:07.650
I never liked him from the start.

00:19:08.450 --> 00:19:11.290
Did Mr. Kang give you a hard time when I wasn't around?

00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:15.260
- No, not at all. - He must have been harassing you.

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:18.000
Goodness.

00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:29.410
From now on, if anything happens, you have to tell me.

00:19:29.770 --> 00:19:31.480
Don't let him walk all over you.

00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:37.110
I'm here to protect you, Chung Ja. Not the other way around.

00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:40.320
That's the whole reason I joined 2ONE Entertainment.

00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:59.200
This is the absolute last time. Just turn a blind eye this once,

00:19:59.570 --> 00:20:00.740
and just think about your future.

00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:02.969
What? That girl...

00:20:02.970 --> 00:20:04.610
What is it? Do you know her?

00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:10.050
I've seen her around. She seemed off so I tried to talk,

00:20:10.550 --> 00:20:12.020
but she seemed in pain.

00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:15.750
You're so close to your debut. Are you going to give up like that?

00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:20.760
- How? - Well...

00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:24.660
She had bruises on her body.

00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:27.300
That's why I've been worried about her.

00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:36.540
Put your seat belt on.

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:48.250
Are you going to follow them? What for?

00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:49.819
Call it a cop's hunch.

00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:50.890
I'm just going to check it out.

00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:53.490
Gosh! We're going to lose them.

00:21:16.250 --> 00:21:17.750
What's that building?

00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:21.590
- Wait here. - Be careful.

00:21:48.150 --> 00:21:49.210
Can I help you, sir?

00:21:49.710 --> 00:21:51.779
Oh, I'm here for the restaurant.

00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:53.680
- There is no restaurant. - What's going on?

00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:54.750
Just checking, sir.

00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:56.389
Oh, the cold noodle place upstairs, right?

00:21:56.390 --> 00:21:57.449
There isn't one.

00:21:57.450 --> 00:21:58.819
Like I said, there isn't one. Now get out.

00:21:58.820 --> 00:21:59.890
Please leave.

00:22:02.130 --> 00:22:03.290
Yes, okay.

00:22:04.390 --> 00:22:06.230
Was it the building next door?

00:22:16.510 --> 00:22:18.710
You know that I'm only doing what I am told.

00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:20.140
Just because you're told to, you do everything?

00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:23.510
Could you have made me do this if I were your sister?

00:22:30.090 --> 00:22:31.190
No way.

00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:34.490
Kang Du Won. Is that crazy punk still at it?

00:22:43.730 --> 00:22:45.269
Were you able to check it out?

00:22:45.270 --> 00:22:48.340
Security's too tight to get in. There's no back entrance, either.

00:22:49.510 --> 00:22:52.779
Looks like they're on the top floor. We can just come back later.

00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:53.940
Hold on.

00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:57.980
Let's just wait a little longer. At least until she comes out.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:50.000
Excuse me.

00:23:57.670 --> 00:23:58.780
Do you still...

00:23:59.580 --> 00:24:01.110
not need someone to talk to?

00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:10.750
I went through something difficult once, too.

00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:14.790
So difficult that I couldn't tell a single soul.

00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:19.400
Do you want to hear my story for a minute?

00:24:22.030 --> 00:24:23.130
And why should I?

00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:32.480
Because you remind me so much of myself back then.

00:24:46.890 --> 00:24:47.990
What?

00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:49.690
What?

00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:52.460
What's going on?

00:25:16.990 --> 00:25:18.720
Why are you telling me this?

00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:23.690
You're just prying to see if the same thing happened to me.

00:25:23.930 --> 00:25:26.629
No, it's not like that at all.

00:25:26.630 --> 00:25:30.970
Coincidence? Please. I saw you following me from the office.

00:25:31.370 --> 00:25:34.839
No, I think you've got the wrong idea.

00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:37.510
Why? Did they tell you to spy on me?

00:25:38.510 --> 00:25:40.940
Told you to see what I'd say?

00:25:42.150 --> 00:25:44.610
I signed an NDA, and that should be enough!

00:25:46.750 --> 00:25:48.080
No, that's not it.

00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:50.120
Wait!

00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:54.860
How long have you been standing there?

00:25:56.130 --> 00:25:59.800
How could you leave while I slept? What if something happened?

00:26:01.230 --> 00:26:04.030
I just thought it might be better if we talked girl-to-girl.

00:26:04.570 --> 00:26:05.870
It didn't go well, though.

00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:09.470
How can you possibly get through to kids like that?

00:26:13.540 --> 00:26:15.880
You're not even a real manager,

00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:18.920
so how do you know what it's like for trainees so well?

00:26:28.090 --> 00:26:29.560
I've seen it before.

00:26:31.390 --> 00:26:32.660
Someone who couldn't stop...

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:35.500
and ended up getting burned.

00:26:47.210 --> 00:26:48.310
Please, help me.

00:26:52.780 --> 00:26:54.080
Call 911.

00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:55.950
- Hurry! Are you okay? - Are you okay?

00:26:57.590 --> 00:26:58.690
What's the situation?

00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:03.960
We got a DNA sample, but we can't identify the offender.

00:27:09.470 --> 00:27:10.700
I think he put something in my drink.

00:27:20.910 --> 00:27:22.580
I don't remember anything after that.

00:27:23.150 --> 00:27:25.020
How did you end up there?

00:27:25.650 --> 00:27:27.250
He said he'd make an introduction.

00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:31.450
That it would help me land a role.

00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:34.460
It's my fault.

00:27:35.460 --> 00:27:37.530
I was so stupid to fall for that.

00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:39.960
It's not your fault.

00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:44.230
You did absolutely nothing wrong.

00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:50.910
I'm going to catch those punks for you. No matter what.

00:27:52.140 --> 00:27:53.180
I promise.

00:27:55.010 --> 00:27:56.480
So, don't you worry. All right?

00:27:59.050 --> 00:28:02.420
Do you promise?

00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:06.120
I promise.

00:28:12.730 --> 00:28:15.730
- Gosh, it's stuffy. - Boss.

00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:30.810
How long has that punk been tailing us?

00:28:31.310 --> 00:28:33.980
- About two weeks. - That's the same punk as before.

00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:36.090
Yes.

00:28:39.190 --> 00:28:42.130
Yes. Sir, I'm terribly sorry, but for now,

00:28:42.390 --> 00:28:45.160
I'll handle your security from a different location.

00:28:46.060 --> 00:28:49.530
No, it's nothing like that. Yes, we've got a fly buzzing around.

00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:51.729
A horsefly. Yes.

00:28:51.730 --> 00:28:55.170
He's, not the kind of guy an assemblyman should deal with.

00:28:55.510 --> 00:29:00.909
But since he's a cop, it's tricky for me to take care of him directly.

00:29:00.910 --> 00:29:03.379
Yes. Don't you worry about a thing.

00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:04.410
Yes.

00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:07.420
The darn horsefly!

00:29:08.050 --> 00:29:11.860
Do you think I'm doing this for me? I'm doing this to save you!

00:29:11.990 --> 00:29:12.990
Just drop it.

00:29:13.420 --> 00:29:14.860
I said stop!

00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:18.530
(Dokgo Cheol)

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:22.200
I'm off.

00:29:39.580 --> 00:29:41.450
No!

00:29:41.890 --> 00:29:43.290
It's all my fault.

00:29:44.850 --> 00:29:46.890
I never should have gone there that day.

00:29:48.990 --> 00:29:50.759
I was a fool to think I'd get a break...

00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:53.099
if I just did what my agency said.

00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:54.559
(Will)

00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:57.470
I regret that stupid, split-second decision so much.

00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:01.600
Detective, you were the only one on my side.

00:30:02.670 --> 00:30:03.840
I'm sorry.

00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:09.080
I'm the one who broke our promise, not you.

00:30:10.650 --> 00:30:12.320
So, please, stop feeling guilty.

00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:56.490
- Yes, Boss. - Hey, you still kicking?

00:30:57.490 --> 00:31:01.800
Turns out there's a reason that woman has nine lives. Get it?

00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:07.200
She has a pig stuck to her like a shadow,

00:31:07.470 --> 00:31:09.670
playing bodyguard with his life on the line.

00:31:10.540 --> 00:31:13.810
- What could even Kwak Jung Do do? - I'm sorry, sir.

00:31:14.110 --> 00:31:18.150
You know me. I may not be book smart,

00:31:18.550 --> 00:31:20.280
but I've gotten this far on loyalty alone.

00:31:23.950 --> 00:31:27.390
- I never abandon my family. - I know, Boss.

00:31:29.830 --> 00:31:32.100
Just lay low until after the election.

00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:44.270
Just make sure Jung Do can't do anything stupid.

00:31:44.370 --> 00:31:45.410
Yes, sir.

00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:56.720
Excuse me.

00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:02.630
I'm sorry. About the news article.

00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:05.160
Why would you be?

00:32:05.330 --> 00:32:08.160
I feel like I'm dragging down a big star,

00:32:09.430 --> 00:32:10.830
like I've become a burden.

00:32:11.670 --> 00:32:15.310
- Because you got involved with me. - I wanted this.

00:32:17.340 --> 00:32:20.780
The only reason I took this part is because I heard you were in it.

00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:24.810
I've been waiting a long time. After I gave you my number.

00:32:36.190 --> 00:32:39.260
You still remember that?

00:32:41.630 --> 00:32:42.930
Because I never stopped waiting.

00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:52.080
- Se Ra. - What? What is it?

00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:54.540
Why have you been spacing out?

00:32:56.680 --> 00:32:58.650
What are you grinning about?

00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:04.850
- "Because I never stopped waiting." - Oh, you heard that?

00:33:04.950 --> 00:33:08.189
Oh, my goodness, Se Ra, you got a confession from Won Ban!

00:33:08.190 --> 00:33:09.890
I thought my heart was going to explode!

00:33:10.860 --> 00:33:13.600
Se Ra, you two should just go public!

00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:15.729
No way.

00:33:15.730 --> 00:33:17.969
What do you mean, "no way?" Is it not the right time to date?

00:33:17.970 --> 00:33:19.470
Or, what, you're not into Won Ban?

00:33:22.940 --> 00:33:24.210
Don't tell me...

00:33:24.910 --> 00:33:27.180
It's not because of your manager, is it?

00:33:30.450 --> 00:33:32.379
Oh, my. Are you insane?

00:33:32.380 --> 00:33:33.679
You've lost your mind!

00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:36.749
Are you rejecting Won Ban for a manager with a pretty face?

00:33:36.750 --> 00:33:39.089
He's more than just a pretty face, you know.

00:33:39.090 --> 00:33:40.919
Oh, my goodness.

00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:45.159
Listen, he's that old and still a temp manager.

00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:47.259
It's not that he couldn't. He chose not to.

00:33:47.260 --> 00:33:49.200
Taking his side already?

00:33:49.830 --> 00:33:53.239
Hello? I spent decades supporting a loser.

00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:54.699
You need to get a grip.

00:33:54.700 --> 00:33:56.709
- He's a detective. - A detective?

00:33:56.710 --> 00:33:59.010
What detective?

00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:03.980
A detective?

00:34:12.860 --> 00:34:13.920
Mr. Manager.

00:34:15.890 --> 00:34:17.560
I'm on your side.

00:34:21.930 --> 00:34:24.130
I thought you were a fan of Won Ban's just a second ago.

00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:35.180
Well, I have a bit of a weakness for law enforcement.

00:34:37.150 --> 00:34:41.279
No wonder. I knew there was something special about you.

00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:42.990
- Gosh, this is something else. - What...

00:34:43.590 --> 00:34:45.460
Looking at you from the side...

00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:47.960
- And from the front... - We're on set, so...

00:34:49.160 --> 00:34:50.390
Even from the back...

00:34:51.030 --> 00:34:52.900
That job really suits you.

00:34:54.130 --> 00:34:56.970
- What do you mean? - Hey, that's sexual harassment.

00:34:58.370 --> 00:35:00.070
Women can get arrested for that too, you know.

00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:04.470
Hold on. Oh, my gosh, Hui Yeong!

00:35:06.740 --> 00:35:10.679
This is actually perfect. Whenever the Won Ban rumors came up,

00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:13.979
you'd get so stressed out. But I guess that's over now.

00:35:13.980 --> 00:35:15.750
And all thanks to Se Ra, no less.

00:35:17.490 --> 00:35:20.819
The public loves shipping singles. It's not like this is anything new.

00:35:20.820 --> 00:35:23.090
But isn't this a little different, though?

00:35:23.630 --> 00:35:26.360
I heard Won Ban liked Se Ra best.

00:35:28.930 --> 00:35:30.000
Now what are you talking about?

00:35:30.300 --> 00:35:33.169
- I overheard it earlier. - Okay.

00:35:33.170 --> 00:35:36.440
- Won Ban said to Se Ra... - Hui Yeong.

00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:38.340
Please, get ready.

00:35:41.710 --> 00:35:42.880
You should go.

00:35:44.610 --> 00:35:45.820
Gosh, you're gorgeous.

00:35:50.290 --> 00:35:52.820
Those two look great together, don't they?

00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:57.390
So, what was it that Won Ban said?

00:36:01.460 --> 00:36:03.929
- He said... - Oh, don't listen to her.

00:36:03.930 --> 00:36:05.799
Everything she says is baseless.

00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:08.540
Well, I'd still like to hear it.

00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:12.509
Wait a minute. My stories are baseless?

00:36:12.510 --> 00:36:13.579
Oh, please.

00:36:13.580 --> 00:36:15.709
Then is any of the gossip from your clients ever true?

00:36:15.710 --> 00:36:17.580
This time I heard it clearly with my own two ears, okay?

00:36:17.650 --> 00:36:20.349
Right, so could you just tell me what it was you heard? Please.

00:36:20.350 --> 00:36:23.850
Hey, I said no spreading rumors. And you're on set doing it again.

00:36:24.050 --> 00:36:26.789
Fine, I won't! I won't say anything.

00:36:26.790 --> 00:36:29.859
Seriously. I swear I won't say another word.

00:36:29.860 --> 00:36:31.429
- No, wait... - I'm just so upset.

00:36:31.430 --> 00:36:33.099
Why did I get married for this?

00:36:33.100 --> 00:36:34.159
Marrying you was a mistake.

00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:36.370
- Wait, but... - Wait, what were you going to say?

00:36:37.100 --> 00:36:38.770
Seriously, why did he come?

00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:40.640
Darn it.

00:36:43.170 --> 00:36:44.170
Yes?

00:36:45.710 --> 00:36:46.810
What about Ju Seung Pil?

00:36:48.780 --> 00:36:50.210
He just got to the club.

00:36:51.410 --> 00:36:53.580
He's practically clocking in here every day.

00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:56.120
All right, keep a close eye on him.

00:36:57.050 --> 00:36:58.690
Will Kwak Jung Do show up?

00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:01.860
He could only hide for so long. He is bound to show his face.

00:37:02.390 --> 00:37:05.260
- Just keep watching. - But I can't tomorrow.

00:37:07.130 --> 00:37:08.200
Why not?

00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:10.670
Wine club again?

00:37:10.900 --> 00:37:16.570
No, it was all guys, so I quit. Nowadays, it's all about makgeolli.

00:37:18.410 --> 00:37:21.310
Oh, makgeolli. Right.

00:37:24.780 --> 00:37:25.920
Okay.

00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:29.549
Enjoy your drinks tomorrow. But today, you must stick with it.

00:37:29.550 --> 00:37:30.550
Okay. I'm hanging up.

00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:34.960
Man, what a time to be alive. Seriously.

00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:36.330
Yes, it's so much better.

00:37:38.860 --> 00:37:40.260
Oh, no, it's nothing.

00:37:40.330 --> 00:37:42.430
You have tomorrow off, right?

00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:49.440
A deposit of 16,000.45 dollars. Is that correct?

00:37:49.570 --> 00:37:50.910
Yes, that's correct.

00:37:51.110 --> 00:37:54.580
You've now paid off all the late fees and the principal.

00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:58.250
We were about to seize your assets, so I'm glad you made it in time.

00:37:58.810 --> 00:37:59.820
Tell me about it.

00:38:03.890 --> 00:38:06.290
But she was marked as present. What do you mean she's not there?

00:38:06.620 --> 00:38:09.060
Look, I even got a text message saying she checked in.

00:38:09.430 --> 00:38:12.290
How can she not be here? That makes no sense.

00:38:34.950 --> 00:38:36.820
Hey, are you okay?

00:38:51.370 --> 00:38:53.970
Your debut is coming up soon. Your schedule must be insane, right?

00:38:55.810 --> 00:38:57.510
Still, I'm so jealous.

00:38:58.010 --> 00:39:01.640
Honestly, who knows how long I'll be stuck as a trainee.

00:39:02.810 --> 00:39:06.050
Nothing to be jealous of. This wasn't just handed to me.

00:39:08.950 --> 00:39:10.890
What's that supposed to mean?

00:39:11.790 --> 00:39:13.160
Practice is a wrap for today.

00:39:28.870 --> 00:39:29.970
Where have you been?

00:39:30.470 --> 00:39:31.510
Mom.

00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:33.910
Take this off.

00:39:36.050 --> 00:39:37.150
Mom!

00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:42.590
What is this?

00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:46.319
I told you I want to be a star. No, I'm going to be a star!

00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:50.160
Which is exactly why I told you in no uncertain terms not to do it.

00:39:50.190 --> 00:39:51.590
And you insist on going down this path anyway.

00:39:51.790 --> 00:39:55.459
It's my life, not yours, Mom. This is what I want to do!

00:39:55.460 --> 00:39:57.430
And look at what this life did to your aunt.

00:39:58.700 --> 00:40:02.770
That path ended up destroying her. And you want to do the same?

00:40:02.940 --> 00:40:03.970
Look at her now.

00:40:04.370 --> 00:40:05.540
She's made a huge comeback.

00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:08.480
No. Absolutely not!

00:40:10.350 --> 00:40:12.280
I'm going to sue this darn company.

00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:16.089
How dare they go behind my back and sign a minor?

00:40:16.090 --> 00:40:19.220
- I submitted a consent form! - What consent form?

00:40:20.120 --> 00:40:22.790
I never gave my permission! So who signed it?

00:40:40.580 --> 00:40:41.580
Baek Ja?

00:40:50.620 --> 00:40:53.560
Well, you're looking pretty good.

00:40:55.990 --> 00:40:57.130
Is something wrong?

00:40:57.290 --> 00:41:00.060
Are you happy now you've dragged my daughter into this snake pit?

00:41:01.260 --> 00:41:04.800
Are you happy to be back in that wretched world you came from?

00:41:05.130 --> 00:41:08.299
A snake pit? I don't know what's going on, but...

00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:11.670
It's not that you don't know. You just don't want to.

00:41:12.540 --> 00:41:14.610
It's always been all about you, hasn't it?

00:41:15.010 --> 00:41:17.810
You're the kind of person who never cared about family.

00:41:23.650 --> 00:41:27.119
I've been letting this slide, but aren't you going too far?

00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:28.360
Now you're acting like the Bong Chung Ja I know.

00:41:29.860 --> 00:41:30.959
How have I gone too far?

00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:35.199
From the day I debuted as a student to the moment I had my accident,

00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:37.770
I never lived a single moment for myself.

00:41:38.470 --> 00:41:41.899
I hid that we were family so it wouldn't affect your studies.

00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:46.410
I was dragged to the police for Dad, and had my hair pulled by victims.

00:41:46.810 --> 00:41:48.180
I don't know what...

00:41:51.050 --> 00:41:53.850
I don't know what I've done that's so terrible in your eyes,

00:41:55.220 --> 00:41:58.950
but after my accident and amnesia, I tried to come back out of guilt.

00:41:59.490 --> 00:42:01.560
Do you have any idea how hard I struggled?

00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:07.060
That was for the family, you say?

00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:09.199
The money I made after my comeback,

00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:11.030
I spent it all on you and Dad.

00:42:11.530 --> 00:42:13.300
What more do you want from me?

00:42:15.300 --> 00:42:16.340
Fine.

00:42:18.110 --> 00:42:21.110
You think acting like a decent human for a bit changes who you are?

00:42:22.750 --> 00:42:24.350
It must be convenient for you not to remember.

00:42:25.650 --> 00:42:30.590
You don't remember what you did, how you left and cut us all off.

00:42:36.830 --> 00:42:40.200
I cut you all off?

00:42:41.100 --> 00:42:43.470
You should have stayed away for good.

00:42:44.970 --> 00:42:47.600
What's the point of this darn blood tie?

00:42:49.240 --> 00:42:53.310
Well, how am I supposed to know if you don't tell me?

00:42:55.540 --> 00:42:56.980
You forgot it all, so you have peace.

00:42:57.280 --> 00:42:58.910
No need to stir up old troubles.

00:43:02.620 --> 00:43:04.720
I won't let my daughter ruin her life,

00:43:04.990 --> 00:43:06.990
trying to become a celebrity like you.

00:43:08.090 --> 00:43:12.560
So don't ever show your face to us. Not to Da Hee,

00:43:13.130 --> 00:43:14.330
and not to me.

00:43:15.430 --> 00:43:16.730
We don't need you.

00:43:33.550 --> 00:43:38.390
You don't remember what you did, how you left and cut us all off.

00:43:58.240 --> 00:44:00.140
Excuse me.

00:44:00.410 --> 00:44:04.280
- You have another visitor. - A visitor?

00:44:15.090 --> 00:44:17.430
You can't run away over this.

00:44:17.630 --> 00:44:21.600
This is partly your fault, Aunt. So I'll be crashing here for a bit.

00:44:22.930 --> 00:44:25.630
Have you seen the mess in this room? You still want to stay here?

00:44:25.730 --> 00:44:27.400
It's better than home with my mom.

00:44:32.170 --> 00:44:36.510
When you had me sign that, you should've said what it was for.

00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:38.450
You wouldn't have signed it if I had.

00:44:40.780 --> 00:44:42.480
My goodness, who do you get that from?

00:44:43.650 --> 00:44:45.750
Mom always says I'm a spitting image of you.

00:44:51.430 --> 00:44:55.560
I'm telling you, your mom will never back down.

00:44:55.960 --> 00:44:57.270
Neither will I.

00:44:57.700 --> 00:44:58.800
Then what's your plan?

00:44:59.500 --> 00:45:01.440
I'm going to make it big and prove her wrong.

00:45:02.540 --> 00:45:05.840
So you're not going home until that happens?

00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:08.740
Please keep our relationship a secret from the agency.

00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:11.310
How can you be sleeping right now?

00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:22.890
Da Hee is with me,

00:45:23.060 --> 00:45:24.160
so don't worry.

00:45:32.030 --> 00:45:33.070
Hold on a second.

00:45:34.070 --> 00:45:37.340
It's simple. This is my niece, Bong Da Hee.

00:45:37.910 --> 00:45:39.309
And this is my aunt.

00:45:39.310 --> 00:45:43.779
Okay, so aunt and niece. You're both with 2ONE Entertainment,

00:45:43.780 --> 00:45:46.220
and you want me to keep it quiet. Is that about right?

00:45:46.580 --> 00:45:48.819
Right? Gosh.

00:45:48.820 --> 00:45:50.920
And how long do you think a secret like that will last?

00:45:51.090 --> 00:45:54.260
Well, your detective secret is safe, isn't it?

00:45:54.290 --> 00:45:56.330
Hey, that's... What?

00:45:57.060 --> 00:45:59.230
Hey, you can't say that out loud!

00:45:59.560 --> 00:46:04.370
Don't worry. You hide our secret, I'll hide yours.

00:46:04.530 --> 00:46:06.570
Da Hee, get in the front. Let's roll!

00:46:17.450 --> 00:46:18.450
All right.

00:46:21.950 --> 00:46:26.119
Look, I didn't ask for this, but I'm your guardian for now,

00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:28.919
so come home right after practice.

00:46:28.920 --> 00:46:30.990
Home? It's a gosiwon.

00:46:32.660 --> 00:46:34.500
Call me if you're going to be late.

00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:36.699
Hey, answer me!

00:46:36.700 --> 00:46:39.540
- Fine. - Go on.

00:46:40.070 --> 00:46:41.070
You got this!

00:46:45.340 --> 00:46:48.880
Don't say a word. I'm already completely overloaded.

00:46:50.210 --> 00:46:52.780
You know, you two really look alike.

00:46:53.550 --> 00:46:54.550
How so?

00:46:56.020 --> 00:46:57.620
You've both got spunk.

00:46:59.860 --> 00:47:01.260
What spunk?

00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:05.660
Did he, or did he not, say that last time was the final time?

00:47:06.300 --> 00:47:07.330
He did, sir.

00:47:07.430 --> 00:47:09.899
He said it would be the last time after the election.

00:47:09.900 --> 00:47:12.130
Gosh. It's always "the last time."

00:47:14.040 --> 00:47:15.040
What about the girl I sent last time?

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:18.970
Well... He requested a new one.

00:47:19.210 --> 00:47:22.410
That freeloader has no right to be so darn picky.

00:47:27.450 --> 00:47:30.620
- Hello, sir. - This is our newest trainee.

00:47:31.250 --> 00:47:34.920
- Is she 6th batch or 7th? - She's pretty.

00:47:35.420 --> 00:47:37.160
- Let's see you blossom. - Yes, sir.

00:47:39.930 --> 00:47:42.300
- I thought the last one was fine. - Hey.

00:47:45.100 --> 00:47:46.100
Who was it?

00:47:46.101 --> 00:47:48.040
- Her name's Riley? - Riley?

00:47:48.140 --> 00:47:49.200
Yes.

00:47:57.450 --> 00:48:00.580
Riley, are you ready? Come on down.

00:48:10.990 --> 00:48:13.260
I'm so jealous. She's getting called up already.

00:48:17.400 --> 00:48:18.600
Riley.

00:48:21.940 --> 00:48:24.310
Hey. I want to make the debut team, just like you.

00:48:24.810 --> 00:48:25.810
And?

00:48:25.870 --> 00:48:28.880
I just met with the CEO, and he said I have potential.

00:48:30.380 --> 00:48:33.250
- He really said that to you? - Can I go with you?

00:48:35.020 --> 00:48:37.550
- Do you even know where I'm going? - It's somewhere good, right?

00:49:23.330 --> 00:49:25.600
Hey, how did you get in here?

00:49:26.300 --> 00:49:29.340
Oh, I'm with 2ONE Entertainment.

00:49:30.670 --> 00:49:31.810
What's your name?

00:49:32.570 --> 00:49:34.810
It's... Riley.

00:49:35.540 --> 00:49:36.650
Riley?

00:49:38.610 --> 00:49:39.780
Yes, that's her.

00:50:01.170 --> 00:50:03.570
What are you talking about? She already came up.

00:50:07.980 --> 00:50:09.080
Who are you?

00:50:34.740 --> 00:50:39.410
Are you saying 25 years ago, you met the dead Assemblyman Do Ik Hwan?

00:50:39.540 --> 00:50:44.250
He was wearing the same watch, so I just assumed it was him,

00:51:00.260 --> 00:51:01.859
Oh, hey, I was just about to call you.

00:51:01.860 --> 00:51:04.599
Reflect on yourself before you ask a favor.

00:51:04.600 --> 00:51:07.339
Why do I have to work overtime?

00:51:07.340 --> 00:51:09.739
It's just for today. See anything unusual?

00:51:09.740 --> 00:51:10.740
Unusual?

00:51:11.810 --> 00:51:12.910
As a matter of fact, there is.

00:51:13.210 --> 00:51:14.310
What?

00:51:15.240 --> 00:51:18.109
That bruiser, Kwaw Jung Do's right-hand man.

00:51:18.110 --> 00:51:21.450
- The way he's moving is suspicious. - What about it?

00:51:21.620 --> 00:51:22.920
Just a hunch.

00:51:23.220 --> 00:51:25.190
Don't do anything stupid.

00:51:25.950 --> 00:51:28.560
Hey. He's on the move.

00:51:28.890 --> 00:51:31.160
Hey! Don't follow him, it's too dangerous.

00:51:32.590 --> 00:51:33.860
What? Hey, I said don't go!

00:51:34.130 --> 00:51:36.230
Come on!

00:51:36.530 --> 00:51:38.630
Gosh. Where are you? I'll be there.

00:51:38.700 --> 00:51:40.469
Don't get caught and just watch. Okay?

00:51:40.470 --> 00:51:41.970
Don't make a move on your own.

00:51:42.270 --> 00:51:43.339
This guy, I swear.

00:51:43.340 --> 00:51:44.810
Say,

00:51:45.210 --> 00:51:50.010
the sizes here are so limited. You don't carry sizes 77 or 88?

00:51:51.350 --> 00:51:52.649
Gosh.

00:51:52.650 --> 00:51:54.720
This one could work. What do you think of this?

00:51:54.880 --> 00:51:56.180
Gosh.

00:51:56.450 --> 00:51:59.150
If you try that on and it rips, you have to pay for it.

00:52:01.220 --> 00:52:05.230
Something happened 25 years ago, didn't it?

00:52:07.530 --> 00:52:08.630
What are you talking about?

00:52:09.060 --> 00:52:11.969
The day of Se Ra's award ceremony. You didn't get in the car afterward.

00:52:11.970 --> 00:52:13.000
Where were you?

00:52:14.500 --> 00:52:16.810
That was decades ago.

00:52:17.010 --> 00:52:19.140
Isn't it weird you remember that?

00:52:20.340 --> 00:52:21.509
I have to close up.

00:52:21.510 --> 00:52:24.150
- Leave. - That the accident was imminent.

00:52:26.110 --> 00:52:27.220
You knew, didn't you?

00:52:29.750 --> 00:52:33.759
What, are you saying I pushed Se Ra to her death?

00:52:33.760 --> 00:52:36.960
Gosh. Why so defensive?

00:52:39.830 --> 00:52:41.700
Don't tell me it was you.

00:52:42.530 --> 00:52:45.730
The one leaving mean comments online, was that you?

00:52:46.070 --> 00:52:49.140
The truth will come out when the evidence is revealed anyway.

00:52:50.640 --> 00:52:51.740
What evidence?

00:52:51.970 --> 00:52:54.510
Now that Se Ra has it, it's only a matter of time.

00:52:57.150 --> 00:53:00.580
Lim Se Ra has the audio file?

00:53:04.350 --> 00:53:05.520
Audio file?

00:53:11.660 --> 00:53:13.190
I'm curious...

00:53:13.630 --> 00:53:15.660
about what secrets it might be hiding.

00:53:25.670 --> 00:53:26.880
An audio file?

00:53:27.640 --> 00:53:30.549
I heard before your accident, you caused a big scene with someone.

00:53:30.550 --> 00:53:31.580
The man with the watch.

00:53:33.780 --> 00:53:35.620
Didn't you go after him because you heard that audio file?

00:53:36.650 --> 00:53:39.850
I don't remember anything before or after, so I have no idea.

00:53:40.260 --> 00:53:43.830
I'm sure the secret from 25 years ago is in that file.

00:53:46.360 --> 00:53:47.860
If I did listen to it,

00:53:49.560 --> 00:53:51.170
I wonder where it could be now.

00:54:01.440 --> 00:54:02.880
My feelings for you have never changed.

00:54:03.780 --> 00:54:05.280
And they never will.

00:54:09.680 --> 00:54:11.190
(To be continued in Episode 5)

00:54:15.990 --> 00:54:17.059
Turn it on.

00:54:17.060 --> 00:54:19.829
Goodness, go to sleep. Do you know what time it is?

00:54:19.830 --> 00:54:23.930
- Turn it on. Come on. - All right, fine.

00:54:27.300 --> 00:54:29.800
("Jewelry Store Girl")

00:54:36.510 --> 00:54:39.210
("Jewelry Store Girl")

00:54:46.290 --> 00:54:47.360
Who is it?

00:54:49.520 --> 00:54:50.589
Hello?

00:54:50.590 --> 00:54:53.060
This is Riley. Do you remember me?

00:54:53.330 --> 00:54:55.930
Oh, yes. What's this about?

00:54:57.030 --> 00:54:59.170
A fellow trainee seems to be in danger,

00:55:00.070 --> 00:55:04.210
and she needs help. You were the only one I thought of.

00:55:05.210 --> 00:55:06.840
In danger? Who?

00:55:10.410 --> 00:55:12.350
What? Da Hee?

00:55:14.120 --> 00:55:16.220
Where did Da Hee go?

00:56:23.280 --> 00:56:24.789
Gosh, why is traffic so bad? Unbelievable.

00:56:24.790 --> 00:56:26.149
Faster! Come on.

00:56:26.150 --> 00:56:27.419
- Okay. - We really have to get there fast.

00:56:27.420 --> 00:56:29.090
I know. Just a second.

00:56:29.490 --> 00:56:31.789
Hey, why are you cutting me off?

00:56:31.790 --> 00:56:33.830
This traffic is already driving me crazy.

00:56:34.160 --> 00:56:36.299
That's it. I'm getting out and running.

00:56:36.300 --> 00:56:37.729
Are you crazy? Where are you going alone?

00:56:37.730 --> 00:56:39.729
You keep trying to call the detective, okay?

00:56:39.730 --> 00:56:40.969
Wait, it's dangerous!

00:56:40.970 --> 00:56:42.470
No! What are you going to do by yourself?

00:56:45.140 --> 00:56:47.210
This is insane. Please.

00:57:26.710 --> 00:57:27.819
What is your business here?

00:57:27.820 --> 00:57:30.250
I need to get inside right away. It's urgent.

00:57:30.950 --> 00:57:32.350
This is a restricted area.

00:57:32.590 --> 00:57:34.819
I'm Lim Se Ra. The actress, Lim Se Ra.

00:57:34.820 --> 00:57:35.889
You don't recognize me?

00:57:35.890 --> 00:57:38.459
Lim Se Ra, the actress with 2ONE Entertainment? Is that correct?

00:57:38.460 --> 00:57:41.759
Yes, that's right. I was told to come here immediately.

00:57:41.760 --> 00:57:43.829
They said to come to the top floor immediately.

00:57:43.830 --> 00:57:46.200
Please wait a moment. I need to confirm with upstairs.

00:57:51.640 --> 00:57:53.540
Oh my gosh, what's that? What's wrong with that person?

00:57:55.210 --> 00:57:56.610
Hey! Stop her!

00:57:59.650 --> 00:58:00.650
Get out.

00:58:03.790 --> 00:58:04.990
Over here.

00:58:44.990 --> 00:58:46.030
And who is this?

00:58:46.090 --> 00:58:49.059
She lied about being from 2ONE to sneak in. We caught her.

00:58:49.060 --> 00:58:50.370
I didn't lie.

00:58:51.530 --> 00:58:54.340
I really am a trainee at 2ONE Entertainment.

00:59:03.810 --> 00:59:05.010
The company doesn't know I'm here.

00:59:08.450 --> 00:59:11.820
So you don't know where you are? What's your name?

01:00:05.410 --> 01:00:06.980
You're a feisty one, aren't you?

01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:08.910
Get over here.

01:00:10.010 --> 01:00:11.180
Get over here!

01:00:12.110 --> 01:00:14.850
Let go! I said, let go of me!

01:00:18.290 --> 01:00:22.360
- Let me go! - Da Hee!

01:00:23.160 --> 01:00:24.660
Da Hee, are you in there?

01:00:27.460 --> 01:00:29.960
I'm in here!

01:00:30.300 --> 01:00:31.830
Da Hee, are you okay?

01:00:33.700 --> 01:00:34.740
Da Hee!

01:00:35.640 --> 01:00:36.769
Be quiet!

01:00:36.770 --> 01:00:38.970
The detective will be here soon. Okay?

01:00:39.510 --> 01:00:41.140
- Just hang on a little longer. - Aunt!

01:00:41.780 --> 01:00:42.880
Aunt!

01:00:50.820 --> 01:00:53.550
- Clear out the room. - Da Hee!

01:01:07.670 --> 01:01:08.670
Open the door.

01:01:10.340 --> 01:01:11.440
Open the door!

01:01:59.790 --> 01:02:01.860
Disable the security! Now!

01:02:10.430 --> 01:02:11.430
Oh, no!

01:02:24.910 --> 01:02:25.910
Da Hee?

01:02:26.150 --> 01:02:27.150
Aunt!

01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:31.419
Are you okay? Are you hurt anywhere?

01:02:31.420 --> 01:02:32.750
- I'm okay. - You sure?

01:02:33.020 --> 01:02:34.189
Come on, let's go.

01:02:34.190 --> 01:02:35.289
We can take the elevator.

01:02:35.290 --> 01:02:37.429
No, we don't have the key. Let's take the emergency exit.

01:02:37.430 --> 01:02:38.490
Hurry.

01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:47.870
Isn't it pathetic? All that work, just to end up here.

01:02:48.670 --> 01:02:49.970
Such an amateur move.

01:02:50.170 --> 01:02:52.709
It's over for you. The police are on their way,

01:02:52.710 --> 01:02:55.239
and everyone will find out what you've done.

01:02:55.240 --> 01:02:56.880
We already took care of the evidence.

01:02:57.280 --> 01:02:59.650
So, should we take care of the witnesses now?

01:02:59.850 --> 01:03:01.050
What are you talking about?

01:03:01.550 --> 01:03:05.190
Who do you think gets here first? The cops? Or our clean-up crew?

01:03:08.220 --> 01:03:10.220
- Go down! - No, I can't!

01:03:10.420 --> 01:03:11.659
I can't go down alone.

01:03:11.660 --> 01:03:13.329
Go, now! The police will be here soon.

01:03:13.330 --> 01:03:14.430
Go and get them, hurry!

01:03:48.160 --> 01:03:49.160
What?

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:51.000
Dokgo!

01:03:52.130 --> 01:03:53.329
You came by yourself?

01:03:53.330 --> 01:03:55.540
Gosh, I told you not to go off by yourself.

01:03:57.540 --> 01:03:58.840
I came with this guy.

01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:01.840
I see.

01:04:02.580 --> 01:04:07.350
- Ju Seung Pil. - Took your sweet time getting here?

01:04:07.580 --> 01:04:09.020
How does it feel?

01:04:09.980 --> 01:04:13.990
You searched the world for me, and I'm right under your nose.

01:04:14.290 --> 01:04:19.229
Right. I'm just so overwhelmed. You ignored all our summonses.

01:04:19.230 --> 01:04:23.400
Well, now, you folks are a bit slow on the uptake, aren't you?

01:04:23.530 --> 01:04:27.299
The old case closed with no charges. It wasn't that I didn't go.

01:04:27.300 --> 01:04:29.370
There was no need for me to go.

01:04:30.070 --> 01:04:32.010
So, are you here to rack up some new charges?

01:04:32.070 --> 01:04:35.080
Attempted murder and aggravated assault on an officer.

01:04:36.940 --> 01:04:38.649
- Get him. - Yes, sir!

01:04:38.650 --> 01:04:40.180
Hold on.

01:04:57.730 --> 01:04:58.730
Yes!

01:05:04.140 --> 01:05:07.140
We must verify the report. so please step aside.

01:05:07.170 --> 01:05:09.539
We have no confirmation of that. You're not permitted to enter.

01:05:09.540 --> 01:05:12.949
What do you mean it's not confirmed? Let them in, now!

01:05:12.950 --> 01:05:15.350
There's a kid up there! Hurry!

01:05:15.450 --> 01:05:17.120
Help me!

01:05:18.690 --> 01:05:20.589
Oh, my! Da Hee!

01:05:20.590 --> 01:05:21.990
Aunt...

01:05:22.120 --> 01:05:23.919
Aunt is up there!

01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:26.729
Oh my gosh, no! She's up there! Open the door now!

01:05:26.730 --> 01:05:29.230
- Help! - Oh, no!

01:05:45.980 --> 01:05:47.319
Go!

01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:48.820
Dokgo, behind you! Watch out!

01:06:20.180 --> 01:06:23.020
(Epilogue)

01:06:27.390 --> 01:06:31.289
Oh no, my script! Oh, I'll be right back.

01:06:31.290 --> 01:06:32.629
You should've paid attention.

01:06:32.630 --> 01:06:35.430
You've got me all flustered. I'll be right back.

01:06:35.660 --> 01:06:37.999
- Okay. - Goodness, I'm so...

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:39.530
Take your time.

01:06:44.540 --> 01:06:46.140
People get like that when they get older.

01:06:47.710 --> 01:06:49.210
Mister, are you really a detective?

01:06:49.980 --> 01:06:51.410
Why would a detective also be a manager?

01:06:57.280 --> 01:06:59.589
It's complicated grown-up business.

01:06:59.590 --> 01:07:02.120
I see. You like my aunt, don't you?

01:07:03.420 --> 01:07:05.160
What? Me?

01:07:06.260 --> 01:07:10.200
Me, like your aunt? No, absolutely not.

01:07:10.600 --> 01:07:12.930
It's strictly professional, you know?

01:07:13.370 --> 01:07:15.300
So you go through that for her for no reason?

01:07:16.500 --> 01:07:18.040
What is she to you?

01:07:19.210 --> 01:07:21.080
You've got quite a mouth on you for a kid.

01:07:25.480 --> 01:07:26.910
How am I supposed to explain this?

01:07:30.080 --> 01:07:32.550
Okay, this is top secret. Got it?

01:07:32.920 --> 01:07:33.950
For real.

01:07:36.120 --> 01:07:37.360
- The truth is, - Yes?

01:07:38.090 --> 01:07:40.160
I used to be a big fan of your aunt's.

01:07:42.730 --> 01:07:45.499
You don't know what a big star she was, right?

01:07:45.500 --> 01:07:48.470
That was ages ago. It was before I was even born.

01:07:49.100 --> 01:07:51.470
Was it? You're really young.

01:07:51.940 --> 01:07:54.279
Anyway, you might not know because it was before your time,

01:07:54.280 --> 01:07:57.950
but back then, you couldn't turn on TV without seeing a Lim Se Ra ad.

01:07:58.350 --> 01:08:02.450
Makeup, phones, soft drinks, cars... Her face was on almost everything.

01:08:02.750 --> 01:08:03.979
And don't even get me started on her shows.

01:08:03.980 --> 01:08:06.689
In the violent crimes unit, an office crawling with tough cops,

01:08:06.690 --> 01:08:08.490
the second Lim Se Ra came on TV,

01:08:08.790 --> 01:08:12.230
everyone from the cops to the perps went dead silent.

01:08:14.300 --> 01:08:18.500
I'm serious. Back then, when her show was on,

01:08:18.730 --> 01:08:22.100
the streets were completely empty. It was "Se Ra Time." So all went in.

01:08:23.070 --> 01:08:26.709
Man, the whole world went crazy just to glimpse Lim Se Ra.

01:08:26.710 --> 01:08:27.710
For real.

01:08:29.980 --> 01:08:33.010
Think I could be like her someday?

01:08:36.120 --> 01:08:37.720
- Want my honest opinion? - Yes.

01:08:38.950 --> 01:08:39.950
I'd say...

01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:42.690
the two of you are the same.

01:08:45.490 --> 01:08:46.790
She's here.

01:08:47.900 --> 01:08:50.329
Sorry. I'm late. We have to go. Now.

01:08:50.330 --> 01:08:53.030
- Okay, let's roll. - Let's go.

01:09:42.980 --> 01:09:45.750
(My Troublesome Star)

01:09:46.050 --> 01:09:48.690
She's been badly injured. She's on her way to the hospital.

01:09:49.390 --> 01:09:51.890
If we really go for 2ONE, something's bound to come up, right?

01:09:52.130 --> 01:09:53.830
Of course. Hey, wait.

01:09:54.330 --> 01:09:55.400
What's that?

01:09:56.060 --> 01:09:58.070
We won't let you fight this alone, not like before.

01:09:58.700 --> 01:10:01.640
Are they determined to ruin me? Darn it!

01:10:02.100 --> 01:10:05.140
Because my eyes are finally wide open.

01:10:05.710 --> 01:10:08.810
Is this the best you can do? You just wait.

01:10:09.540 --> 01:10:10.680
I found out...

01:10:11.680 --> 01:10:12.750
what you've done.
