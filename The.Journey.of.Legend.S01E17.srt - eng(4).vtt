[The Journey of Legend]

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.920
[Episode 17]

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.000
Where did you get this token?

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:06.680
What did you do to my family?

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:10.310
It doesn't matter what I did.

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.190
Just think about what you should do.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.240
Now, only you can save

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.030
the Xiao family.

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:24.960
Young Master Xiao,

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.760
why not give him the token now?

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:28.810
-Give it to him. Please.
-Yeah.

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.050
-Let him have it.
-Right.

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.710
-Do it.
-Give it to him, will you?
-Give it to him.

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:38.940
I really don't know
where the Hero Command Token is.

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:40.450
It's not here, he said.

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:42.200
Then think harder.

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:45.710
Try to recall what happened
after you met Old Madam Wu.

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.780
If you are not to die with them,

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.790
then try to think of something.

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:22.010
It's the Seven-Step Deadly Formation
of Tang Sect...

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.930
Was Xiao Qiushui taken away by Tang Sect?

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:59.030
I told you to leave this lad alone.

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.590
Exactly.

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:00.990
But none of you listened.

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:04.320
If you ask me,

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:06.960
I'd say let's have his limbs broken
like ours

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:08.000
to make him spill the truth.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.840
I agree!

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:10.000
My legs...

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:13.430
Dear friends,

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.770
even if you take all my limbs apart,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.910
your injuries simply won't heal.

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:22.650
This is all your fault.

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:23.720
Right now,

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.040
our only option is to work as a team

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.070
to find a way out of this place.

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:31.920
My sister Xiao Xueyu

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:33.710
is an amazing doctor.

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:37.159
I believe she will cure all of you.

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:38.600
Xiao Xueyu?

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:40.159
That's great.

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:41.600
No, no, no.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.400
Are you really that kind?

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:48.070
Well,

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.650
I'm actually not that kind.

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:52.680
But think about this.

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:54.510
Liu Suifeng

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:56.480
is a ruthless man.

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:59.360
Do you think he'll set you guys free?

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.420
-No, he won't.
-No way.

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:03.610
So,

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:05.190
we are

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:08.070
in the same boat now.

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:09.800
That means we need to

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:12.640
stand in solidarity, make joint efforts,

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:17.390
and figure out
how to get out of this place.

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:19.640
We're in the same boat...

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.680
T-That makes us a team of five now, right?

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:23.860
A team of five?

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:25.070
A team of five?

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:26.920
F-Five...

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:28.870
Correct.

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:31.820
We are a team of five now.

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:33.870
W-Well, if we really make it out of here,

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:34.730
but your sister

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.680
refuses to treat our broken legs,

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:37.740
then what can we do?

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:39.990
-That's a possibility.
-Right!
-Yeah.

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:41.200
That won't happen.

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:42.310
My sister

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:43.680
has a good heart.

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:45.090
If you save my life,

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:46.680
then I'll be indebted to you.

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.140
Since I'm indebted to you,

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:50.370
my family will definitely help you.

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:52.890
I don't believe it.

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:53.720
You're lying.

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:56.620
Fine. You may not have trust in my sister.

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:58.750
But you do know about Tang Sect, right?

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:01.510
Tang Sect

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.400
has a remarkable therapy for broken bones.

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:06.430
I have a friend

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:07.610
named Tang Fang.

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:12.590
Although she's a bit
hot-tempered, bossy,

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:14.800
and perhaps unreasonable,

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:15.830
I have firm belief

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:17.890
that if you help me out of here,

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.650
she'll definitely cure all of you.

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:23.270
-Sounds nice.
-Good.

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:24.190
Good idea.

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:26.490
Donglin, you do it.

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:26.950
Me?

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:27.560
I...

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:28.560
Donglin, you're huge.

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:29.490
Go break it open.

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:30.950
Just do it. I don't have any tools.

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:32.750
-Okay.
-Hurry. I can't move my legs.

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:33.560
Hurry!

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:36.670
Here comes Liu Suifeng!

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:49.750
Xiao Qiushui,

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:52.250
what on earth happened?

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:53.980
Didn't you already...

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:00.640
I had to make a snap judgement
at that time.

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:03.830
This is quite a complicated matter.

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:08.270
I'll explain everything to you
in due time.

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:11.280
How dare you lie to me again?

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:15.050
Nobody in the martial world
has the guts to lie to me.

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:17.870
You even locked me up in an iron cage.
How could you?

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:21.430
You must be

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:24.360
the kind-hearted sister
he told us about, right?

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:25.270
She must be!

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:27.330
She's obviously the bossy Miss Tang!

00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:28.160
Shut up!

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:31.070
M-Miss Tang?

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:39.180
I'll give you a chance.

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:40.610
Explain now.

00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:47.520
I can't put my friends in danger again.

00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:49.550
If something bad happens to you,

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:52.480
I'll be utterly guilty about Rou
till the day I die.

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:03.730
You can talk when we're out of here.

00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:05.430
T-That's right.

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:07.960
When Liu Suifeng comes here again,

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:08.560
Miss Tang,

00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:10.110
you'll suffer like us.

00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:11.310
Exactly.

00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:17.390
Liu Suifeng? You met Liu Suifeng?

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:18.560
Yes, we did.

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:19.510
Look at my leg.

00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:20.970
-And my arm.
-He maimed us.

00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:23.860
That's right.

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:26.520
Feng Lang is Liu Suifeng.

00:08:33.090 --> 00:08:34.890
The target isn't here. Retreat.

00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:41.650
When we were fighting the enemy,

00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:43.890
I was indeed confused.

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:46.150
Song Mingzhu has great martial skills.

00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:48.280
She shouldn't have feared him so much.

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:50.840
But if he really is Liu Suifeng,

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:52.850
then that would make sense.

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:55.590
Besides, the setting here...

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:58.200
How is he related to Tang Sect?

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:04.000
We're pressed for time now.

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:06.200
Let's resume the conversation
after we escape.

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:07.960
-Right.
-Yeah. Get out of here first.

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:09.160
Let's get out of here.

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:11.810
Half of the traps here have been disabled.

00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:14.480
The four of you, protect him.

00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:15.960
If you help Mr. Xiao out,

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:17.460
I'll treat you
with the medicine exclusive to Tang Sect.

00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:18.100
Terrific!

00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:19.510
Miss Tang...

00:09:19.510 --> 00:09:21.720
-Deal!
-It's a pact now, Miss Tang.

00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:38.840
Master.

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:41.160
Your formation has been broken.

00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:43.820
Someone rescued Xiao Qiushui.

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:47.140
This person not only solved
this intricate formation of Tang Sect,

00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:48.740
but also saved Xiao Qiushui.

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:50.630
Could it be her?

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:54.240
Fang,

00:09:54.670 --> 00:09:55.320
is he

00:09:55.630 --> 00:09:57.290
really that important to you?

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:04.600
Go!

00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:10.060
Donglin!

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:19.040
Step aside.

00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:26.510
The poison has been eroding
your meridians for too long.

00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:28.460
I'm afraid even its antidote can't help.

00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:29.070
Eat this.

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:32.800
Thank you.

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:40.630
For that potent poison,

00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:42.830
I gave a pill that absorbs ants' toxins.

00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:45.270
Now, you'll have to rely on yourself.

Miss Tang,

00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:12.870
I've noticed you're just

00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:13.750
as an incredible healer

00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:15.810
as that gentle and caring Xiao Xueyu.

00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:16.510
Right!

00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:20.270
You also know Xiao Xueyu?

00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:22.120
Not really.

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:23.840
We heard about her from him.

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:24.600
He told us about her.

00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:25.930
Yes, exactly.

00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:28.750
He said you're difficult, bossy,

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:30.720
-and unreasonable.
-That's right.

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:32.550
Will you treat us

00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:35.440
without us begging you?

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:36.320
Will you?

00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:40.210
Is that what you told them?

00:12:41.270 --> 00:12:42.600
Stop talking nonsense,

00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:44.590
or I'll break all your limbs.

00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:50.430
I didn't mean any of that.

00:12:51.650 --> 00:12:52.250
Boring.

00:13:02.530 --> 00:13:03.750
Have it back. You're its owner.

00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:05.610
Keep your own stuff for yourself.

00:13:23.510 --> 00:13:24.360
Qiushui,

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:26.530
I have one more favor to ask.

00:13:35.150 --> 00:13:37.080
This is called the Golden Swallow.

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:40.060
An old friend of mine left it to me.

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:46.630
He was known as the best

00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:50.500
and the most feared fighter
in the martial world years ago—

00:13:53.250 --> 00:13:54.050
Crazy Yan.

00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:59.720
He was once a disciple of Elder Wubei's,

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:03.080
and the sole inheritor
of the Voidheart Codex.

00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:05.800
Out of jealousy, his fellow disciples

00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:08.250
kidnapped his younger brother and sister

00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:11.960
to coerce him
into surrendering the Voidheart Codex.

00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:13.790
But after Mr. Yan gave them the book,

00:14:13.790 --> 00:14:15.630
those people ate their words.

00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:18.080
As a result, Mr. Yan spent 10 years

00:14:18.270 --> 00:14:21.390
searching desperately for his siblings.

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:23.960
Just when he found a lead,

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:26.550
the Northern Wastelanders happened to

00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:30.150
have sent masters from beyond the borders
to assassinate my son.

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:32.870
Mr. Yan put his frantic search on hold

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:35.360
and rushed to save my son's life.

00:14:38.510 --> 00:14:41.960
Again, he lost the trail
of his brother and sister.

00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:49.120
People all say Crazy Yan looked down on
everyone in the martial world

00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:51.160
with utter impudence.

00:14:52.030 --> 00:14:53.320
But surprisingly,

00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:56.280
he actually had a chivalrous nature.

00:14:57.270 --> 00:14:58.080
Later on,

00:14:58.630 --> 00:15:00.600
Mr. Yan continued his search
at his maximum capacity,

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:02.730
only to find his younger brother dead.

00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:07.000
He slaughtered many a sect
when he hunted for the killer.

00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:09.240
Being one step away from total madness,

00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:12.200
he became Crazy Yan,
who was dreaded by everyone.

00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:17.750
His obsession
with finding his younger sister

00:15:17.790 --> 00:15:22.200
drove him to turn the martial world
into a complete chaos.

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:25.780
That was why he was finally besieged
on Wuxing Mountain

00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:27.690
and knocked off Nantian Abyss.

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:30.000
Despite all that,

00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:35.440
Mr. Yan did do my family a big favor
and show great dedication to the country.

00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:39.550
The Wu family is indebted to him.

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:42.360
In the end,

00:15:43.630 --> 00:15:46.270
he left nothing
but this Gold Swallow in haste.

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:50.460
What about his sister?

00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:53.320
Over these years,

00:15:54.910 --> 00:15:57.770
I've been looking everywhere
for Mr. Yan's sister.

00:15:58.320 --> 00:15:59.120
But I'm afraid

00:16:00.390 --> 00:16:02.190
it'll take a long time to find her

00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:03.970
in this vast martial world.

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:05.750
I'm already old.

00:16:06.630 --> 00:16:11.030
So, I'd like to entrust you
with this Golden Swallow as a keepsake,

00:16:11.550 --> 00:16:13.120
and the task of finding

00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:16.790
Mr. Yan's only surviving family member.

00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:30.030
Old Madam Wu,

00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:32.910
I will do my utmost to find her.

00:16:46.390 --> 00:16:47.960
Miss Tang...

00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:50.790
Miss Tang, sorry to interrupt you.

00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:52.360
Miss Tang!

00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:56.070
Miss Tang... Miss Tang...

00:16:56.910 --> 00:16:57.790
Miss Tang!

00:17:03.630 --> 00:17:05.480
This is the Bone Repairing Salve.

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:07.130
Apply it evenly on the joints.

00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:10.260
Then your broken limbs
will be able to move temporarily.

00:17:11.310 --> 00:17:11.920
However,

00:17:12.550 --> 00:17:14.480
you still need a skilled physician

00:17:14.589 --> 00:17:16.250
to fix your injuries for good.

00:17:16.770 --> 00:17:17.329
Besides,

00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:20.270
this is the Jade Recovery Powder.

00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:21.640
Take it,

00:17:21.829 --> 00:17:25.089
and the seal on your internal energy
will be lifted in time.

00:17:27.450 --> 00:17:28.310
Stop fighting for them!

00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:30.400
-My leg!
-Give me a bottle!
-You're on my leg!

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:31.800
-Stop fighting.
-Get up!

00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:34.790
Give me a bottle.

00:17:34.790 --> 00:17:35.550
Qiushui,

00:17:36.590 --> 00:17:38.160
what exactly happened?

00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:39.870
How did you...

00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:45.010
come back from the dead?

00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:47.270
G-Give it to m-me...

00:17:48.030 --> 00:17:49.830
Perhaps that hit from Qu Hanshan

00:17:51.030 --> 00:17:53.290
put me in a state of suspended animation.

00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:54.350
It hurts!

00:17:54.450 --> 00:17:56.040
That made me look dead.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:57.750
Here, here.

00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:03.490
-It's too much.
-This will do.

00:18:04.510 --> 00:18:05.240
Give it to me.

00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:07.010
I'm just glad you're fine.

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:08.890
No grabbing!

00:18:11.830 --> 00:18:13.350
What will you do next?

00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:14.750
Let me do it.

00:18:16.030 --> 00:18:17.590
Yes, right here.

00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:20.680
-Let me do it. You don't know how.
-Not so hard!

00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:23.110
About the Sword King and Liu Suifeng...

00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:23.770
Let me help.

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:26.420
I did my best to hold them off previously.

00:18:26.650 --> 00:18:29.970
Now, I must head back to Huanhua Sect
as soon as possible.

00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:31.880
I hope Yiren has arrived.

00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:34.770
-Give it to me!
-Let me have it!
-Look at that!

00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:38.820
We'll set out
when they're done applying the salve.

00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:41.960
Okay.

00:18:58.310 --> 00:18:58.790
Xueyu!

00:18:59.070 --> 00:18:59.590
Xueyu!

00:18:59.590 --> 00:19:00.270
What's wrong?

00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:01.000
Are you okay?

00:19:01.750 --> 00:19:03.680
I'm fine. It's an urgent trip.

00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:04.920
Let's keep going.

00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:05.720
Young Master!

00:19:07.030 --> 00:19:07.830
Young Master,

00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:09.030
Second Young Master and Mr. Zuoqiu

00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:10.350
are still nowhere to be found.

00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:11.150
Young Master!

00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:12.790
Young Master,

00:19:12.790 --> 00:19:13.720
good news.

00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:15.550
Third Young Master is still alive.

00:19:15.550 --> 00:19:16.750
What did you just say?

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.030
Did someone tell you that,

00:19:18.030 --> 00:19:19.090
or did you see it yourself?

00:19:19.090 --> 00:19:21.310
I was told that Third Young Master
had been seen alive.

00:19:21.310 --> 00:19:23.270
So, I carefully inquired about him
along the way.

00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:25.270
Someone did see Third Young Master.

00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:26.610
What a blessing!

00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:28.080
Qiushui is still alive.

00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:29.350
Great.

00:19:30.790 --> 00:19:31.450
Qiushui...

00:19:33.550 --> 00:19:36.610
would probably rush back
to the Sword Manor right away.

00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:38.650
-Xueyu.
-Yiren...

00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:44.010
-Xueyu!
-Xueyue!

00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:45.500
Xueyu!

00:19:50.510 --> 00:19:51.510
It's snake venom.

00:19:52.510 --> 00:19:53.640
How did this happen?

00:19:53.790 --> 00:19:55.790
Xueyu was so eager
to return to the Sword Manor

00:19:55.790 --> 00:19:57.480
that she chose to keep her injury secret.

00:19:57.480 --> 00:19:58.640
If she hurries on with the journey,

00:19:58.640 --> 00:19:59.590
she might die.

00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:01.760
But now, the Sword Manor...

00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:03.650
I'll stay and try to help Xueyu.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:04.510
Yiren,

00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:07.160
your priority is to go back
to the Sword Manor

00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:08.360
to save your parents.

00:20:10.110 --> 00:20:11.040
You two stay put.

00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:12.510
The rest will leave with me.

00:20:12.510 --> 00:20:13.170
-Yes!
-Yes!

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.400
My leg is healed!

00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:31.590
My arm is healed!

00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:32.830
My leg is fine now!

00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:37.130
A full recovery!

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.200
-How wonderful.
-All is fine now.
-My leg is fixed!

00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:41.110
Thank you, Miss Tang.

00:20:41.110 --> 00:20:43.270
-Thank you, Miss Tang.
-Many thanks, Miss Tang.

00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:43.960
Thank you.

00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:45.940
Why did you hit me?

00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:47.270
I lost control of my arm!

00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:51.480
You guys were in a mess just now.

00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:53.110
Did you not the apply the salve evenly,

00:20:53.110 --> 00:20:54.400
so your meridians went out of order?

00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:55.470
-Donglin!
-I...

00:20:55.550 --> 00:20:56.790
I told you not to rush!

00:20:56.790 --> 00:20:57.720
Why did you have to fight over the salve?

00:20:57.720 --> 00:20:59.450
What did that have to do with me?

00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:28.510
Liu Suifeng,

00:21:29.270 --> 00:21:31.070
you just can't stop hounding me.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:32.730
Liu Suifeng,

00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:35.680
you know about
the formations of Tang Sect.

00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:37.920
How are you related to Tang Sect?

00:21:38.790 --> 00:21:39.880
Back off, Fang.

00:21:44.550 --> 00:21:45.640
You can't stop me.

00:21:47.450 --> 00:21:48.580
You called me Fang?

00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:51.690
I'm Feng, your childhood friend.

00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:15.720
Feng, run!

00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:16.480
Little brat,

00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:18.540
how dare you set free the boy I picked!

00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:23.310
-Fang!
-Feng!

00:22:32.470 --> 00:22:33.680
You really are Feng?

00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:38.510
I meant to reunite with you
in a better way.

00:22:40.790 --> 00:22:42.190
So you're from Tang Sect.

00:22:45.030 --> 00:22:46.430
As my bosom friend, Feng,

00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:49.000
why would you help the Power Gang do evil,

00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:52.480
and constantly fight against
the Xiao family?

00:22:53.270 --> 00:22:54.600
Do you remember how I was

00:22:55.060 --> 00:22:56.790
taken in by Tang Sect years ago?

00:23:01.070 --> 00:23:04.130
Tang Yaoshun impregnated my mother.
Then, they had me.

00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:08.030
Afterwards, he went back to Tang Sect
as its master,

00:23:08.030 --> 00:23:09.200
while my mother and I

00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:11.130
stayed alone in Baicao Valley.

00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:12.760
However, that vile creature

00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:15.770
Xiao Xilou led many from the martial world

00:23:15.850 --> 00:23:19.520
to raid and butcher Baicao Valley.

00:23:27.550 --> 00:23:29.270
I had a narrow escape from that disaster.

00:23:29.270 --> 00:23:31.680
I meant to ask Old Madam Tang
to help me seek revenge,

00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:33.110
but she just ignored me.

00:23:34.310 --> 00:23:35.510
From my perspective,

00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:37.450
back then, Baicao Valley made...

00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:39.960
B-Baicao Valley made the Marching Pills

00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:40.810
for those invaders

00:23:40.810 --> 00:23:42.270
from the Northern Wasteland.

00:23:42.270 --> 00:23:44.070
Thanks to Mr. Xiao Qiushui's father

00:23:44.070 --> 00:23:46.630
and other righteous martial practitioners,
that place was finally flattened.

00:23:46.630 --> 00:23:48.460
The people there deserved it!

00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:50.970
-Yes. They deserved it!
-They did!
-Yeah!

00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:54.790
-They got their just deserts!
-They did!
-Right!

00:23:54.810 --> 00:23:55.570
Nonsense!

00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:03.030
Baicao Valley always
stood aloof from worldly affairs.

00:24:03.310 --> 00:24:06.170
How could we have possibly
colluded with the enemy?

00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:10.880
It was that schemer Xiao Xilou's fault.

00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:12.510
His greed for our pills and elixirs

00:24:12.510 --> 00:24:13.750
compelled him

00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:16.350
to frame Baicao Valley
and commit atrocities.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.260
My father would never harm the innocent.

00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:24.010
You're talking gibberish.

00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:25.380
I witnessed

00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:27.390
their brutality and violence.

00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:30.510
Fang,

00:24:31.110 --> 00:24:32.950
now that you've learned the truth,

00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:34.550
you shouldn't try to stop me.

00:24:34.790 --> 00:24:35.850
Don't call me Fang.

00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:38.350
You're no longer

00:24:38.350 --> 00:24:40.070
the Feng I knew in childhood.

00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:41.570
Now, in my eyes,

00:24:42.070 --> 00:24:43.550
you're just the overbearing

00:24:43.550 --> 00:24:45.280
deputy chief of the Power Gang,

00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:46.790
Liu Suifeng.

00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:50.590
I joined the Power Gang
by a strange quirk of fate.

00:24:50.860 --> 00:24:52.590
I'll tell you the details later.

00:24:52.590 --> 00:24:53.390
But right now,

00:24:54.030 --> 00:24:55.830
I must get the Hero Command Token

00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:57.540
and find the Voidheart Codex.

00:24:59.160 --> 00:24:59.750
Fang,

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.720
I know you have your missions too.

00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:02.850
When I get the codex,

00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:04.970
I'll definitely lend it to you.

00:25:05.030 --> 00:25:07.030
Why do you have to stick with this man

00:25:07.310 --> 00:25:08.840
and put yourself in danger?

00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:13.140
I don't need your help.

00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:15.760
I did come here for the codex,

00:25:16.350 --> 00:25:18.210
but I care about other things too.

00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:21.480
I'm deeply aware of what can be done

00:25:21.590 --> 00:25:22.960
and what cannot be done

00:25:23.550 --> 00:25:25.110
in the martial world.

00:25:25.750 --> 00:25:26.950
I quest for what I want

00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:28.680
in an honest and fair way.

00:25:29.590 --> 00:25:31.950
I didn't rescue you from hell years ago

00:25:33.230 --> 00:25:34.430
only to let you

00:25:34.670 --> 00:25:36.190
drag others into hell.

00:25:42.070 --> 00:25:42.720
Fang,

00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:46.620
you can't make me stop.

00:25:58.270 --> 00:25:59.270
Deputy Chief Liu,

00:25:59.790 --> 00:26:02.230
isn't it against
the ethics of the martial world

00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:05.360
to attack someone
who has lost all his martial strength?

00:26:09.250 --> 00:26:10.100
Well said!

[Prince Liang of Daxi, Glow Achiever]
[Liang Dou]

00:26:26.740 --> 00:26:28.670
I've led a troop to this very place.

00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:31.230
Liu Suifeng, you'd better tread lightly.

00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:35.170
Your Highness,

00:26:37.270 --> 00:26:39.030
why not go be a carefree prince

00:26:39.990 --> 00:26:42.850
and stay out of this mess
involving the Xiao family?

00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:46.460
Xilou and his wife are my close friends.

00:26:46.580 --> 00:26:47.640
Even catastrophes

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:50.860
can't deter me from helping them,

00:26:50.860 --> 00:26:52.390
let alone this little mess.

00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:56.590
What now?

00:26:57.590 --> 00:26:59.190
Why don't you leave already?

00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:01.240
Do you fancy a fight with us?

00:27:03.510 --> 00:27:05.110
May our paths never cross again

00:27:05.110 --> 00:27:06.640
in this vast martial world.

00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:15.970
Oh, right. Qiushui,

00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:17.330
how are your injuries?

00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:19.830
I'm much better now.

00:27:22.830 --> 00:27:25.290
Your Highness,
thank you for saving my life.

00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:27.830
Now, I'm afraid

00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:30.970
Xiao's Sword Manor won't hold up
for much longer.

00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:33.830
Your Highness, please lend me some horses,

00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:35.690
so I can go back soon.

00:27:35.980 --> 00:27:36.980
Consider it done.

00:27:37.550 --> 00:27:39.510
I've prepared several fast horses for you.

00:27:39.510 --> 00:27:40.710
They can be your ride.

00:27:40.750 --> 00:27:41.750
I heard the sect leaders

00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:43.270
of Shaolin and Wudang had set out.

00:27:43.270 --> 00:27:44.590
You're severely injured now.

00:27:44.590 --> 00:27:45.990
Let me go meet them first.

00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:48.840
Your Highness, I promise

00:27:48.860 --> 00:27:51.490
to repay the generous help
you offered today.

00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:17.240
where is the Hero Command Token?

00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:21.420
Forgive my incompetence.

00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:23.120
I failed to get the token.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:27.800
You've always been meticulous.

00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:30.500
Why did you keep failing the tasks

00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:32.730
involving the Xiao family?

00:28:34.350 --> 00:28:35.610
I tried my best, Chief.

00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:39.490
You've shown absolute loyalty
to the gang over these years.

00:28:39.670 --> 00:28:42.200
But now,
you've had several failures in a row.

00:28:42.350 --> 00:28:44.010
Even if I keep silent about it,

00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:46.770
how will you command respect from others?

00:28:48.070 --> 00:28:50.670
I swear I will bring back
the Hero Command Token

00:28:50.790 --> 00:28:52.650
to convince everyone in the gang.

00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:56.640
Tang Sect, Shaolin Sect and Wudang Sect

00:28:56.680 --> 00:29:00.610
have stayed cleared of the affairs
of the martial world for a long time,

00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:04.840
yet they're now unanimously intervening
with these matters about the Xiao family.

00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:06.500
Shaolin Sect and Wudang Sect?

00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:08.510
The intelligence I just received says

00:29:08.510 --> 00:29:12.070
the sect leaders of Shaolin and Wudang
have rushed to the Xiao Residence.

00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:13.240
Go stop them.

00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:15.460

00:29:18.850 --> 00:29:19.480

Master,

00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:34.290
if we fight Shaolin Sect and Wudang Sect
at the same time,

00:29:34.290 --> 00:29:35.290
there might be...

00:29:42.230 --> 00:29:43.030
Might be what?

00:29:44.490 --> 00:29:45.290
Deputy Chief,

can penetrate everything.

On the other hand, Taichan's sword skills

00:29:52.310 --> 00:29:53.350

00:29:53.350 --> 00:29:54.640

If those two join forces,

00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:04.500
they can make a perfect duo in combat.

00:30:05.310 --> 00:30:07.910

That said,

it's no doubt
that confronting these two major sects

00:33:09.750 --> 00:33:11.920
We'd like to gift it to Shaolin Sect.

00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:14.400
It would be a huge shame for all Buddhists

00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:17.030
if such a precious item
went missing again.

00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:21.780
This sutra is indeed highly valuable
for Buddhism.

00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:26.160
But upholding justice for the Xiao family
takes precedence over it.

00:33:28.030 --> 00:33:28.920
In that case,

00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:31.400
I'll destroy it then.

00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:47.960
Still intact.

00:33:48.820 --> 00:33:51.950
You obviously can't bring yourself
to see it get ruined.

00:34:01.390 --> 00:34:03.250
This is the authentic Mind Sutra.

00:34:04.330 --> 00:34:06.240
Though to plot against me,

00:34:06.270 --> 00:34:08.190
you hid poisonous bugs in it,

00:34:09.630 --> 00:34:12.040
it'd still be a pity
to let it go to rack and ruin.

00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:13.830
So you did figure out its secret.

00:34:13.830 --> 00:34:14.920
[Mind Sutra]

00:34:18.760 --> 00:34:20.489
What powerful poisonous bugs.

00:34:20.590 --> 00:34:21.840
It takes some energy

00:34:22.030 --> 00:34:23.550
to kill them.

00:34:44.190 --> 00:34:44.920
Red Phoenix.

00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:45.920
Master!

00:34:47.030 --> 00:34:49.830
-Master!
-Master Tianzheng!
-Master Tianzheng!

00:34:54.989 --> 00:34:56.790
It seems I'm still one step late.

00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:01.360
Your Finger of Vicissitudes
is impressive, old monk.

00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:03.560
But I've finally managed to injure you.

00:35:04.770 --> 00:35:05.720
I put all my strength

00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:07.470
into that strike I threw at you.

00:35:07.830 --> 00:35:09.290
Old monk, that was too much

00:35:10.510 --> 00:35:11.700
even for you, right?

00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:17.190
Amitabha.

00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:17.840
Master,

00:35:18.070 --> 00:35:19.670
I'm going to kill all of them!

00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:21.600
-Junior!
-Baoxiang.

00:35:22.380 --> 00:35:23.880
The qi in you is overwhelming.

00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:25.590
To avoid going to the extreme,

00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:27.400
you must not fight again.

00:35:27.670 --> 00:35:28.710
Yes, Master.

00:35:32.710 --> 00:35:34.800
Master Tianzheng is highly revered
in the martial world.

00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:36.710
You're trying to kill him
in broad daylight.

00:35:36.710 --> 00:35:37.840
Don't you fear Shaolin Sect

00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:40.000
will see the Power Gang
as its mortal enemy?

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:40.600
Fear?

00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:44.070
I think it will be Shaolin, Wudang, and Emei Sects

00:35:44.070 --> 00:35:46.070
that fear making an enemy
of the Power Gang.

00:35:46.070 --> 00:35:47.130
Are you attempting

00:35:47.710 --> 00:35:50.570
to plunge the entire Daxi martial world
into chaos?

00:35:50.630 --> 00:35:51.890
Then let's have a match

00:35:52.250 --> 00:35:55.050
and find out who has the reign
of the martial world.

00:35:56.140 --> 00:35:58.340
You think we're intimidated by you lot?

00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:03.880
Kill them!

00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:26.860
[Master Taichan]
[Leader of Wudang Sect]

00:36:28.110 --> 00:36:29.550
Taichan, there you are.

00:36:30.190 --> 00:36:31.880
How very nice.

00:36:36.670 --> 00:36:37.360
Tianzheng,

00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:39.920
look at you, being reduced to such a state

00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:41.450
by these younger fighters.

00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:44.170
You don't seem to have made much progress.

00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:46.990
Tianzheng,

00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:48.330
you're injured.

00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:49.460
I'll help you heal.

00:36:49.630 --> 00:36:51.030
When your condition gets better,

00:36:51.030 --> 00:36:52.110
we'll join forces.

00:36:52.740 --> 00:36:56.000
This young crowd from the Power Gang
can't be a threat to us.

00:36:57.630 --> 00:36:59.230
Amitabha.

00:36:59.670 --> 00:37:02.110
Master Tianzheng's internal injuries
seem severe.

00:37:02.110 --> 00:37:04.070
How can he stabilize his condition
right here?

00:37:04.070 --> 00:37:04.880
Tianzheng is able to do it,

00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:06.140
though others may not.

00:37:06.510 --> 00:37:08.630
His Finger of Vicissitudes not only kills

00:37:08.630 --> 00:37:09.590
those who touch it,

00:37:09.590 --> 00:37:10.920
but also heals injuries

00:37:11.070 --> 00:37:12.550
and revives the dead if used properly.

00:37:12.550 --> 00:37:14.360
Tianzheng, I'll help you heal.

00:37:14.550 --> 00:37:16.880
Then, let's team up

00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:18.340
and have an awesome fight.

00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:20.550
What a good idea.

00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:22.220
Sect Leader Mo,

00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:24.260
I'll leave these guys to you.

00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:31.320
Come on.

00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:50.560
Young lady, you're not half bad.

00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:52.680
You actually managed to survive

00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:54.290
my Waterfall Sword Strike.

00:39:55.280 --> 00:39:56.320
But I still advise you

00:39:56.320 --> 00:39:57.440
to simply retreat.

00:39:57.840 --> 00:39:59.360
Wudang Sect
is known for its defensive skills.

00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:00.590
If I am to leave Tianzheng unattended

00:40:00.590 --> 00:40:02.800
and to end your lives one by one,

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:04.660
it won't be quite easy indeed.

00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:06.480
But I suggest you never think of

00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:08.890
breaking in and attacking us,

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:10.860
if you aren't as good as Crazy Yan.

00:40:14.070 --> 00:40:15.930
We are certainly no match for you.

00:40:16.630 --> 00:40:17.630
Nonetheless,

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:20.840
you two have both been poisoned.

00:40:26.530 --> 00:40:28.000
It's the Energy Suppressing Powder?

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:28.800
That's right.

00:40:29.070 --> 00:40:31.150
It's exactly
Wu Kuyu's Energy Suppressing Powder.

00:40:31.150 --> 00:40:35.350
I'm afraid you'll find it difficult
to pool the internal energy inside you.

00:40:35.470 --> 00:40:37.200
This devious little trick

00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:39.700
can hardly harm me and...

00:40:46.510 --> 00:40:47.030
Master!

00:40:47.160 --> 00:40:47.850
Tianzheng!

00:40:55.590 --> 00:40:56.590
What is going on?

00:40:57.510 --> 00:40:58.590
It's the sutra.

00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:07.110
Master Tianzheng,
when you grabbed the Mind Sutra,

00:41:07.110 --> 00:41:09.630
you killed the poisonous bugs
with your Finger of Vicissitudes, right?

00:41:09.630 --> 00:41:12.150
Those were Radiant Algae Bugs.

00:41:12.710 --> 00:41:14.880
When you killed them
with your Finger of Vicissitudes,

00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:17.540
they became algae powder
attaching to the book,

00:41:17.590 --> 00:41:20.150
and was later transferred to your hand,
Master.

00:41:20.150 --> 00:41:22.230
When you used your Finger of Vicissitudes
to heal your wounds,

00:41:22.230 --> 00:41:24.370
they were revived
by the miraculous power in it,

00:41:24.370 --> 00:41:27.570
transformed back into bugs,
and then went into your body.

00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:30.000
As Master Taichan helped you heal,

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:31.670
the bugs naturally moved

00:41:31.670 --> 00:41:33.270
into Master Taichan's body.

00:41:33.590 --> 00:41:36.150
We sacrificed so many lives
in the previous attacks

00:41:36.150 --> 00:41:37.880
just to make you two
use your inner energy,

00:41:37.880 --> 00:41:39.760
so that the bugs could be activated.

00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:43.090
If it hadn't been for
the old monk's Finger of Vicissitudes,

00:41:44.510 --> 00:41:47.040
these bugs wouldn't have
kicked into effect.

00:41:49.630 --> 00:41:50.960
You despicable people!

00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:54.760
It turns out you knew
I'd come here in the first place.

00:41:55.150 --> 00:41:57.710
You did all that stuff just to trap me.

00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:01.550
Amitabha.

00:42:01.700 --> 00:42:03.330
Father, Mother!

00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:18.150
The Power Gang?

00:42:20.090 --> 00:42:20.740
Qiushui!

00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:28.590
Qiushui!
