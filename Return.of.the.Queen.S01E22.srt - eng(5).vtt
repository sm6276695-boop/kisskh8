[Subtitles in the making and will be available soon]

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.360
Lu Si Yu.

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:00.480
Lu Si-woo.

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:17.160
Si-woo.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:40.280
Haimeng.

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:41.360
Don't go down.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.079
Hai Meng.

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:01.760
If we

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.240
never met,

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.240
If you were not

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:08.320
in my life,

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:10.640
Haimeng.

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:12.360
I really

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:15.360
really love you.

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:28.960
Haimeng.

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:29.960
Hang in there.

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:30.480
Haimeng.

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:35.880
Haimeng.

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:36.800
Please wait.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:37.520
Haimeng.

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.000
Everything will be fine.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:13.560
Didn't you

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.080
to Yunhai International?

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.040
Isn't it today?

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:18.279
a board meeting today?

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.120
Why are you back?

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.200
Where's Si-woo?

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:34.520
Where's Si-woo?

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:35.800
Where's my brother?

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:41.360
What's that look?

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.960
I'm asking you.

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:45.040
Where is Lu Si Yu?

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:49.440
Si-woo...

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.520
It's gone.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.240
What do you mean?

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:12.200
Si-woo.

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:15.600
Si-woo.

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:17.480
Si-woo!

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:21.360
Si-woo.

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:22.440
Haimeng.

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:23.720
Haimeng.

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:24.480
How are you?

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:25.440
Are you okay?

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:26.160
Where's Si-woo?

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:28.000
Where's Si-woo?

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:32.440
Haimeng.

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:32.880
Haimeng.

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:34.000
Your lungs are full of water.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:34.400
Haimeng, you can't move.

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:34.960
I don't need it.

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:35.480
Calm down.

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:36.200
I'm fine.

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:36.960
I'm really fine.

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:37.280
You can't go.

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:38.000
Call the police.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:38.640
Call the police.

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:39.280
Haimeng.

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:40.360
Haimeng.

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:41.080
Haimeng!

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:42.440
Let go of me!

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:43.120
Hai Meng.

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:43.720
Let go of me!

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:44.360
Don't go, Hai Meng.

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:45.040
Let go of me!

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.480
You can't go.

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:46.440
Let go!

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:48.080
Let go of me!

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:49.040
Let go!

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:50.120
Si Yu is gone.

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:51.880
Ye Bochen.

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:01.120
What's wrong with Si Yu?

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:10.040
What's wrong with him?

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:15.920
What's wrong with him?

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:18.040
Haimeng.

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:22.240
Si-woo fell into the sea

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:24.960
is the most dangerous place in the dark.

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:27.880
Everyone jumped down to save them,

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:30.280
but only you.

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:32.159
Si-woo was taken away.

00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:35.880
Police! Rescue! Emergency ship!

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:36.840
They're all here.

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:38.640
for almost two hours.

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:39.720
for almost two hours.

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:41.600
I'm afraid

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:43.080
He...

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:43.960
He has...

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:02.080
Impossible.

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:04.880
You're lying.

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:06.400
Haimeng.

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:07.760
Impossible.

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:10.160
Impossible.

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:10.760
Haimeng.

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:12.360
Impossible.

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:13.720
Haimeng.

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:14.240
Impossible.

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:17.440
Impossible.

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:19.120
Haimeng.

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:19.600
Haimeng.

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:20.200
Haimeng.

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:21.520
Haimeng.

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:22.640
Doctor.

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:23.120
Haimeng.

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:24.920
Doctor.

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:25.440
Doctor!

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:26.400
Doctor.

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:27.960
Haimeng.

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:28.560
Haimeng.

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:30.720
Doctor.

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:31.680
Haimeng.

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:36.360
What do you mean?

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:40.240
It's gone.

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:43.240
Dad.

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:45.840
What do you mean?

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:48.800
What happened?

00:07:52.159 --> 00:07:52.920
Uncle Mo.

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:54.120
Tell me clearly.

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:55.960
What's wrong with my brother?

00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:57.560
Why didn't he come back

00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:58.480
with you?

00:07:58.760 --> 00:07:59.400
Uncle Mo.

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:01.200
Tell me, Uncle Mo.

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:01.920
Si Yue.

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:02.680
Tell me.

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:02.960
Don't do this.

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:04.240
Say something, Uncle Mo.

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:05.160
What's wrong with my brother?

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:06.240
Don't do this.

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:07.040
Take it easy.

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:08.560
How can I take my time?

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:12.400
My brother.

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:13.920
Why did he

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:15.080
suddenly disappear?

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:17.200
Why?

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:18.840
Why?

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:19.440
Enough.

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:21.640
I haven't seen you

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:22.560
care about him.

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:25.000
Something happened.

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:27.200
Just stay here.

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:28.160
and yell

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:29.360
your father.

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:31.360
That's all.

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:32.760
He's gone.

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:34.720
He asked for it.

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:37.000
and jumped off.

00:08:37.799 --> 00:08:38.240
Dad.

00:08:39.559 --> 00:08:41.400
How could you say that?

00:08:41.919 --> 00:08:42.600
Si Nam is me.

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:43.919
My half-brother.

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:45.760
Si-woo is my half-brother.

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:47.320
who grew up together.

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:48.440
Yes.

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:49.520
I know

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:51.120
always favors your brother and brother.

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:52.920
But it doesn't mean

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:54.720
I don't have them in my heart.

00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:58.720
Si-woo is in trouble.

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:00.520
How could you say that?

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:02.360
Without Si-woo,

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:04.000
nothing happened?

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:06.000
Life and death

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:08.640
is his choice.

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:09.640
Dad.

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:17.920
I, Lu Changdong,

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:20.200
have two good sons.

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:22.440
One is in the notarized will.

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:23.120
in the notarized will.

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:24.360
One

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:25.800
for the sake of the family,

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:29.440
He chose to jump into the sea.

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:30.760
Okay.

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:34.760
You all like to die, right?

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.280
Then all of you will die!

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:40.720
I, Lu Changdong,

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:41.760
I donâ€™t need a son.

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:43.680
I don't need a daughter.

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:45.720
or family.

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:48.200
You are my burden.

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:50.360
Baggage.

00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:53.680
Loser!

00:09:58.960 --> 00:09:59.520
Dad!

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:01.160
Dad.

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:01.800
Si Yue.

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:02.320
Dad.

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:03.080
Si Yue.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:41.560
Haimeng.

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:42.760
I brought your favorite.

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:44.440
Haimeng.

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:45.960
Doctor.

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:46.800
Nurse!

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:47.440
What's wrong?

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:49.400
Didn't I tell you to watch Hai Meng?

00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:50.280
Where is she?

00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:51.400
The doctor asked me to sign it.

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:52.840
I thought I'd be back in two minutes.

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:54.400
Don't worry.

00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:55.200
Let's find someone first.

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:19.720
Si-woo.

00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:21.200
Where are you?

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:22.480
I'll pick you up.

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:24.600
Si-woo.

00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:26.120
Come back soon.

00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:28.000
I'll wait for you under my tree.

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:30.440
I will wait for you to come back.

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:32.640
Come back.

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:33.360
Tell me.

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:36.160
you will come back.

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:52.880
Jie.

00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:55.560
Go to the fire station now.

00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:56.560
Haist Rescue Bureau.

00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:57.680
Go pick up Si-woo.

00:12:58.240 --> 00:12:59.400
To pick up Si-woo.

00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:12.240
Mr. Feynn.

00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:14.120
Could you please

00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:15.400
find Si-woo for me?

00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:18.480
He fell into the sea.

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:19.960
But I know he must be alive.

00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:21.240
He must be alive.

00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:22.680
Can you help me find him?

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:41.160
Haimeng.

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:41.760
Haimeng.

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:43.360
Haimeng.

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:03.080
Haimeng.

00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:12.240
Ling Ke.

00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:13.960
You came at the right time.

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:14.760
I sent

00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:15.600
to Si-woo.

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:16.560
but he didn't reply.

00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:17.520
Can you

00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:18.480
call him

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:19.600
Help me find him.

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:20.960
Help me find him.

00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:23.840
Hai Meng.

00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:24.960
Don't do this, Hai Meng.

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:25.520
Ling Ke.

00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:26.560
Where's your phone?

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:27.680
Where is your phone?

00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:28.520
Hai Meng.

00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:30.280
Haimeng, wake up.

00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:32.040
Lu Si Yu fell into the sea.

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:33.480
Haist Rescue and Fire Team

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:34.800
I searched him all day.

00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:36.720
He's gone.

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:37.320
He disappeared.

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:38.360
He's gone.

00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:40.080
No way.

00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:42.040
Si-woo won't disappear.

00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:43.280
He promised me

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:44.800
he would come back.

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:46.680
He will always be with me.

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:48.160
Si-woo said

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:49.400
he would come back

00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:50.600
he'll come back.

00:14:58.480 --> 00:14:59.800
I'll call Si-woo.

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:00.840
Hai Meng.

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:02.320
Haimeng, wake up.

00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:03.680
Stop lying to yourself.

00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:05.360
Lu Siyu has...

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:06.000
Ling Ke.

00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:22.640
It's Si Yu.

00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:25.600
Hai Meng.

00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:26.680
It's me.

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:28.120
Do you remember

00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:29.240
the night

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:30.120
that night,

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:31.640
did I ask you

00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:32.720
three requests?

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:34.160
At that time,

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:35.840
my third request

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:37.000
is still empty.

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:38.880
Now,

00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:40.480
I'm going to use this number three.

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:42.400
The last request

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:43.760
is

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:45.240
Ye Haimeng.

00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:47.040
Live.

00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:48.800
No matter what happens,

00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:51.400
no matter how hard it is,

00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:53.360
please remember

00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:54.840
how you survived

00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:56.480
from that disaster?

00:15:57.360 --> 00:15:58.160
How did you

00:15:58.160 --> 00:15:59.280
to come back?

00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:00.600
I hope

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:03.200
even when I'm not around,

00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:05.920
you are still brave and firm.

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:07.680
and live freely

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:09.760
and live freely.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:11.640
Haimeng.

00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:14.800
I love you very much.

00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:25.520
Haimeng.

00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:30.160
If you want to cry,

00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:31.920
just cry.

00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:18.119
How did it go?

00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:19.800
Did you find him?

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:21.359
Any news about Si-woo?

00:17:22.319 --> 00:17:23.200
Is he saved?

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:24.920
Where's Dad?

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:26.000
Leave Dad alone.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:27.319
Tell me the news first.

00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:29.600
Dad is in the study, right?

00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:30.840
I'll talk to dad first.

00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:32.520
Tell me first.

00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:34.120
Tell me first.

00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:36.040
Did you find Si-woo?

00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:37.360
Is he saved?

00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:47.640
Si Yue.

00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:50.080
I'm not telling you in detail.

00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:52.080
I don't want you to be sad.

00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:54.760
Officer, help!

00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:56.560
[Withdraw search]

00:17:56.560 --> 00:17:57.440
Three days and three nights.

00:17:58.240 --> 00:17:59.280
But apart from

00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:01.400
Si-woo's jacket,

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:02.360
nothing else.

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:05.480
The most experienced

00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:06.640
The rescue captain said

00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:08.320
the sea where Si-woo fell

00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:09.960
is the most ferocious sea of the dark stream.

00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:12.520
When Si-woo falls,

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:14.200
It's like the tide.

00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:15.920
After he fell down, he was gone.

00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:18.240
Rescue team.

00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:19.720
It's lucky that

00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:20.560
to find Ye Haimeng.

00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:24.280
It's past

00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:25.440
the golden time for rescue.

00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:28.480
Si-woo.

00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:30.560
I'm afraid...

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:36.800
Si Yue.

00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:47.400
But I don't believe it.

00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:51.040
I don't believe Si-woo just left.

00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:54.000
He didn't leave a word.

00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:55.720
Not a word.

00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:57.200
to me.

00:18:57.800 --> 00:18:59.360
he wouldn't leave like this.

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:02.560
Although he was naughty

00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:04.840
and doesn't call me sister,

00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:07.320
But he is my brother.

00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:09.800
My brother.

00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:16.600
Whether we fight,

00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:18.120
or fight,

00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:21.640
Even if I complain in this house,

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:23.600
parents value sons more than daughters.

00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:26.320
They complain that my mom doesn't love me.

00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:28.400
I complained that in this house,

00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:30.920
I have my brother Lu Si Nan,

00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:32.800
and my brother Lu Si Yu.

00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:34.600
I'm the most

00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:36.800
in this family.

00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:38.880
who was neglected.

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:40.960
But I hope

00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:42.120
they can live.

00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:43.600
I hope my brother

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:45.360
can live forever.

00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:46.240
Si Yue.

00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:49.440
Don't think like that.

00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:51.240
In this house,

00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:52.680
no one looks down on you.

00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:56.080
Whether it's Si-woo,

00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:57.600
Si Nam.

00:19:57.960 --> 00:19:58.880
They all treat you

00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:00.080
as their closest family.

00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:06.960
Is there any other way?

00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:07.960
Honey.

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:09.760
Is there any way

00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:11.240
to save Si Yu

00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:12.480
and keep the Lu family safe.

00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:15.040
Yes.

00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:16.640
Let's go find Ye Haimeng.

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:18.440
and let us go.

00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:21.000
We beg for peace for the Lu family.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:22.160
and let us go.

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:23.600
Let my brother and brother go.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:24.560
Si Yue.

00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:25.200
Si Yue.

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:25.880
Si Yue.

00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:27.760
It's not like that.

00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:29.720
It has nothing to do with Ye Haimeng.

00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:30.280
Even if you go to her,

00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:31.680
won't solve the problem.

00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:32.680
It will only stimulate

00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:33.840
between the Ye family and the Lu family.

00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:34.440
What should we do?

00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:36.200
Then what?

00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:40.600
I'd rather suffer at home

00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:42.120
and be ignored by my dad.

00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:43.680
and forgotten by my dad.

00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:45.440
But I hope

00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:46.440
my brother can live.

00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:49.080
I want him to live.

00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:55.600
Let's calm down.

00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:57.280
Now the Lu family

00:20:57.280 --> 00:20:58.760
in the Lu family.

00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:00.040
We have to bear

00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:01.240
of the Lu family.

00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:03.000
When the Ye family

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:03.840
the Ye family,

00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:05.800
Everything will pass.

00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:09.920
Trust me.

00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:11.680
Everything will be fine.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:33.200
What took you so long?

00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:37.000
I'll clean up the mess.

00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:40.640
Are you going to...

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:51.920
Ling Ke.

00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:54.160
is Zhang Yujie's daughter.

00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:56.600
During his sentence,

00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:57.520
a sudden brain hemorrhage.

00:21:58.080 --> 00:21:59.320
A few years ago,

00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:00.960
a few years ago.

00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:02.040
Ling Ke picked her up.

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:05.680
Why didn't we

00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:07.040
any news?

00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:07.560
So,

00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:09.280
what have you been busy with these years?

00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:10.200
It's such a big matter.

00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:11.560
about such a big thing.

00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:14.000
Do you know

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:14.720
Ling Ke.

00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:17.320
She approached Ye Haimeng on purpose.

00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:18.080
Her purpose

00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:20.320
is for us.

00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:22.000
What should we do now?

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:23.000
What should we do?

00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:25.200
Hurry up.

00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:27.000
get out of this mess.

00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:28.440
As soon as possible.

00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:30.320
Hurry up.

00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:31.720
to go abroad.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:32.960
If you stay any longer,

00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:33.960
if we stay here.

00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:38.320
Wherever we go,

00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:42.280
We'll go wherever the money is.

00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:44.280
Okay.

00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:38.200
Haimeng.

00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:41.080
Are you feeling better?

00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:43.960
Do you want to eat something?

00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:46.560
Or

00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:47.640
do you need me

00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:48.560
for you?

00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:56.680
Well,

00:23:57.400 --> 00:23:58.560
if you want to do something,

00:23:58.960 --> 00:23:59.920
or need anything,

00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:02.000
call me anytime.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:03.960
I'll be waiting for you.

00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:47.600
Ye Haimeng.

00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:49.440
Live.

00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:51.200
No matter what happens,

00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:53.800
no matter how hard it is,

00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:55.880
please remember

00:24:56.520 --> 00:24:57.040
how you

00:24:57.040 --> 00:24:58.920
survive from that disaster?

00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:00.600
How did you

00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:01.560
to come back?

00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:03.040
I hope

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:05.640
even when I'm not around,

00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:08.320
you are still brave and firm.

00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:10.040
and live freely

00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:12.160
and live freely.

00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:27.720
I hope I can be with you

00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:32.680
Travel through adversity

00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:35.000
At the end of the stars

00:26:56.840 --> 00:26:57.440
Ke.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:26:58.600
Come on.

00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:01.600
I want to fight back.

00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:08.080
According to your friend's description,

00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:09.480
Yunhai.

00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:12.000
The beginning of the interaction with long-distance capital

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:13.040
started from

00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:15.040
from Western Asia.

00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:18.320
This deal

00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:19.600
was set up

00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:20.880
from the beginning.

00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:22.280
My dad found out

00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:23.320
their trap

00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:26.200
because of their trap.

00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:26.800
That's right.

00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:28.480
Due to the decision of the former chairman,

00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:30.080
the clouds

00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:30.920
fall into

00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:32.040
by Lu Changdong.

00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:33.680
But in the later stage,

00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:35.840
in the later cloud.

00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:37.240
of the large-scale funds.

00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:38.840
Ye Yue Ji is very cunning.

00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:40.600
For the past five years,

00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:41.560
all the accounts

00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:42.960
were managed perfectly.

00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:45.840
All the money

00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:47.440
to the land buyer?

00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:48.440
I'm not sure about that.

00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:49.760
What about the domestic information?

00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:51.280
is far more exaggerated

00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:52.120
than we thought.

00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:54.840
Long Road Group

00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:56.240
has developed rapidly over the past decade.

00:27:56.560 --> 00:27:58.200
In China,

00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:00.200
all over the country.

00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:03.360
They made enough money.

00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:04.160
Six years ago,

00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:06.080
I made a hasty decision

00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:07.080
I made a hasty decision.

00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:09.480
But he's not capable enough to sail on a long way.

00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:11.600
with the local government.

00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:12.840
overseas labor overseas.

00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:13.960
The company was forced

00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:14.320
to

00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:15.560
a lot of backup funds.

00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:16.720
Later,

00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:18.240
we met a special time.

00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:19.480
domestic and foreign industries.

00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:20.640
A huge investment

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:22.160
disappeared overnight.

00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:26.080
That's why the long-distance domestic cash flow

00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:27.040
and collapsed.

00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:28.840
Not only that,

00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:30.320
they also set foot

00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:32.520
high-interest loans.

00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:34.640
A legitimate channel.

00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:35.760
Lower-level channel.

00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:37.040
Such a huge loophole.

00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:38.560
The legitimate channel

00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:40.360
can't stand it.

00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:42.320
Got it.

00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:44.120
So six years ago,

00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:45.800
a long road expanded overseas.

00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:47.160
But the overall plan failed.

00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:48.200
and the company

00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:49.480
high interest financing.

00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:51.600
To prevent the headquarters from falling,

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:53.080
Lu Changdong.

00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:54.640
came up with a plan to harvest the clouds.

00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:56.680
to fill the long road

00:28:57.080 --> 00:28:58.480
to fill the long road.

00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:00.280
That's right.

00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:02.600
The beginning of all things

00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:03.880
should be like this.

00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:10.800
What's going on inside Yunhai?

00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:12.440
We already got

00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:13.960
Lu Si Nan's inheritance.

00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:15.320
But due to the sudden

00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:16.160
the notarized will

00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:17.320
which makes the total

00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:18.320
37 percent

00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:19.280
is frozen again.

00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:21.320
And

00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:22.800
the shareholders

00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:23.680
in the board of directors

00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:25.040
in the seat

00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:26.040
and control

00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:27.760
to control you.

00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:30.960
Also,

00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:34.120
those branch companies

00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:35.280
the branch companies

00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:41.480
finance and political affairs

00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:43.920
to the headquarters?

00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:49.960
Haimeng.

00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:51.080
This time,

00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:52.560
this time?

00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:55.560
Give me some time.

00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:56.960
Let me think about it.

00:29:57.680 --> 00:29:58.800
Think about

00:29:58.800 --> 00:29:59.960
how to break the game.

00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:01.600
I'm going back too.

00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:02.880
and touch the effective information.

00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:03.680
and bring it back to you.

00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:15.920
Do you have anything else to say?

00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:22.640
About me.

00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:24.240
I'm sorry

00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:26.440
I'm sorry.

00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:30.440
Do you think

00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:32.520
I've kept you by my side for so long.

00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:34.480
and told you all the secrets.

00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:36.560
Do you think I don't know who you are?

00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:39.680
Are you sure?

00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:42.160
She is the former financial director

00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:43.560
former financial director,

00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:45.760
Zhang Yujie's only daughter.

00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:51.480
I see.

00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:53.040
Thank you.

00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:56.120
So from then on,

00:30:56.560 --> 00:30:58.080
you already knew who I am.

00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:03.800
Since I landed at the honeymoon hotel,

00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:05.320
you've been following me.

00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:07.480
If you didn't want to kill me,

00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:08.800
he must have asked me for help.

00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:10.160
But that accident

00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:11.360
broke your plan.

00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:14.120
In order to clear her name,

00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:15.560
to contact

00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:17.360
the top management of Yunhai Finance,

00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:19.360
can only help me.

00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:20.360
Right?

00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:24.120
Yes.

00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:27.920
If I'm in trouble,

00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:29.480
I'll believe

00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:30.160
a stranger

00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:31.480
by my side,

00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:35.440
I'm not qualified

00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:36.960
to control the whole Yunhai International.

00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:42.240
But on this journey,

00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:44.280
I've stopped treating you

00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:45.360
as a game in my hand.

00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:47.040
Because of you,

00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:49.360
because of you.

00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:51.240
Ling Ke.

00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:53.520
Thank you.

00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:12.320
Haimeng.

00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:15.920
Thank you.

00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:36.120
The secret document is behind the oil painting.
