Daughter.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:05.960
My sweet girl.

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:27.360
I have performed

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.040
a comprehensive examination on her

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.560
as requested by Ms. Ling Ke.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:31.440
Her vital signs are

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.320
relatively stable.

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.880
But

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.079
the prognosis for her wrist fracture

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:35.880
and the spinal implant surgery
in her lumbar region

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.200
is quite poor.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.920
Some time ago,

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.520
while she was undergoing treatment
at my clinic,

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.000
signs of infection had already emerged.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000
At that time, I advised her

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.200
to undergo another surgery.

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.200
But it seems now

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:45.800
she has no intention of doing so.

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.640
Spinal implant surgery?

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:48.760
Her high fever and loss of consciousness

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.240
are likely due to discitis

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.240
and the recurrence of old injuries.

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:53.720
The damp weather

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.079
and severe emotional distress

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:56.360
have further exacerbated her condition.

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:57.320
For now, all we can do is

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:58.880
alleviating her inflammation and pain.

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:59.760
Beyond that,

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.690
there are
no more effective medical interventions.

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:04.360
This medicine box

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:05.040
contains her commonly used painkillers

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.960
and anti-inflammatory medications.

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:07.880
Tonight,

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:09.880
please do not leave her side.

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.080
Try to stay with her as much as possible.

00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:22.440
Ms. Ye,

00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:25.120
you are Lu Sinan's wife.

00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:26.080
Mare Nubium is

Moreover,

00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:29.520
according to your

00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:31.000
postnuptial asset trusteeship agreement,

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:31.600
the Lu family holds

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:34.200
inheritance rights
to half of Sinan's shares.

00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:36.320
As the eldest son-in-law of the Lu family,

00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:37.800
I've been entrusted by my parents-in-law

00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:39.520
to manage them on their behalf.

You're the Lu family's eldest son-in-law.

00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:47.680
does anyone in the Lu family

00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:48.940
actually respect you?

00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:49.840
You're

00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:51.520
just a frontman for the Lu family

00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:53.120
and a scapegoat for Lu Siyue.

00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:55.080
Know your place in the Lu family

00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:56.580

00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:14.540
Dad didn't mean to offend you.

00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:15.800
We can all still sit

00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:17.280
and talk things through.

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:21.520
I asked you

00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:24.580
whether you wanted to be my friend or foe.

00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:25.880
Now it seems

00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:29.530
you've chosen to stand against me.

00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:31.770
That's not true.

00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:35.520
Get out.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:38.320
You don't get to speak here.

00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:39.000
Haimeng.

00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:39.720
Haimeng,

00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:40.920
let me explain, okay?

00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:41.440
Haimeng,

00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:42.760
it's not what you think!

00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:43.480
Haimeng!

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.400
During my 3-year absence from Mare Nubium,

00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:51.570
Ye Yuezhi mismanaged operations,

00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:53.360
causing internal chaos.

00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:55.400
From now on,

00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:59.490
Ye Yuezhi will be relieved of his role
of Vice President.

00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:05.520
Haimeng.

00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:08.170
Am I hearing correctly?

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:10.960
You want to dismiss me too?

00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:14.200
Let's not even discuss

00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:16.400
whether you have the authority.

00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:17.970
On a personal level,

00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:20.200
I am your uncle.

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:22.440
For 30 years,

00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:23.920
your father, mother,

00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:25.480
and I

00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:28.440
have managed Mare Nubium.

00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:30.520
At least half of this

00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:33.160
was managed by me for your father.

00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:34.280
During

00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:35.960
your 3-year absence,

00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:37.840
Bochen and I

00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:39.920
worked diligently

00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:41.520
to guard Mare Nubium for you.

00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:43.520
How can you

00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:45.840
kick down the ladder
right after you came back?

00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:47.000
Why target me?

00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:49.040
You guarded Mare Nubium for me?

00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:54.690
You guarded Mare Nubium for me,

00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:57.080
but my mother was sent

00:22:57.080 --> 00:22:58.480
to a private sanatorium—

00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:01.180
her whereabouts unknown.

00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:05.280
Yet those with ulterior motives

00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:07.480
took high positions at Mare Nubium.

00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:09.360
You hold my mother's shares,

00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:10.840
but you let the Ye family

00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:12.040
lose actual control.

00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:14.890
That's how you guarded Mare Nubium for me?

00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:23.140
Ye Yuezhi is dismissed
from his role of Vice President,

00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:26.080
effective immediately.

00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:31.160
Ye Haimeng!

00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:33.600
Ye Haimeng!

00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:36.320
Why did you remove

00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:37.680
Jiang Lin's president nameplate?

00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:38.440
Do you really want to seize

00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:39.640
Mare Nubium?

00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:41.970
What did you say?

00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:44.120
I said you want to seize Mare Nubium!

00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:45.280
Half of Mare Nubium

00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:46.640
belongs to my brother.

00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:49.130
You're trying to take it all for yourself!

00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:54.200
Mention Lu Sinan in front of me again,

00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:55.200
and I'll show you

00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:56.760
who the true owner

00:23:56.760 --> 00:23:57.760
of Mare Nubium is.

00:23:58.440 --> 00:23:58.960
You...

00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:00.490
Who are you trying to scare?

00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:12.340
You're scared?

00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:17.800
Save the threats.

00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:20.320
Today, even if you

00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:22.600
dismiss Jiang Lin

00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:24.520
and drive out your Uncle Yuezhi here,

00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:25.640
Mare Nubium

00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:28.240
will never be yours alone.

00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:29.800
Never?

00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:37.960
Since your marriage with Sinan,

00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:39.880
Mare Nubium

00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:41.680
has become your shared marital property.

00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:43.040
Before your incident,

00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:44.760
you signed

00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:46.720
a property custody agreement.

00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:49.000
It clearly bears

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:50.120
your signature.

00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:52.660
You agreed that after Sinan's incident,

00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:54.960
your shared assets

00:24:56.840 --> 00:24:58.080
would be managed

00:24:58.600 --> 00:24:59.760
by the Lu family.

00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:01.680
Now,

00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:03.800
Sinan's death declaration

00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:05.080
hasn't been processed yet.

00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:06.760
The shareholding structure
of Mare Nubium's major shareholders is

00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:07.960
disorganized.

00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:09.040
It's still unclear

00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:10.440
how many shares you truly hold

00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:11.360
in Mare Nubium.

00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:13.200
What right do you have
to dismiss Jiang Lin?

00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:14.400
What right do you have

00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:16.320
to be Mare Nubium's president?

00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:28.440
Madam is right.

00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:30.840
We haven't even confirmed

00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:32.560
if you're
Mare Nubium's largest shareholder.

00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:33.560
I'm afraid

00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:34.520
you can't

00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:35.960
be the president.

00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:37.280
You think

00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:38.680
bringing a dead person's photo

00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:40.280
will make Mare Nubium yours?

00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:42.760
To have a say here,

00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:44.720
you need shares.

00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:46.640
Ke.

With just that fraction,

00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:13.890
you think you can control Mare Nubium?

00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:15.600
Under the names of you and Sinan,

00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:16.720
there's

00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:18.080
an inseparable 37%.

You're back.

00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:52.520
I've been waiting for you here.

00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:53.040
I thought

00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:54.440
I might not see you today.

00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:55.080
I was thinking

00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:56.280
if you didn't come home,

00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:57.200
I would call you.

00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:58.440
If you didn't answer,

00:29:58.440 --> 00:29:59.280
I'd have no choice

00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:00.340
but to go to Bochen.

00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:02.480
Have you forgotten

00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:04.210
every word I said to you before?

00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:05.200
What you said?

00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:07.680
That I should stay away from you?

00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:08.840
But I also said

00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:10.180
I don't want to.

00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:13.760
Do you even know

00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:14.880
what's happening between me

00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:15.810
and your family?

00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:16.800
My family?

00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:18.610
Siyue and my mother?

00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:19.720
I know you're fighting

00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:20.880
over Mare Nubium.

00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:21.920
You know?

00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:23.040
I know

00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:24.320
the conflict between you is

00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:26.450
because of my brother and Mare Nubium.

00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:28.360
Those hotels and company shares—

00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:30.080
I'm not interested in any of them.

00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:31.120
In life,

00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:32.280
money matters.

00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:33.680
But beyond money,

00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:35.410
there are things you can't buy,

00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:37.450
can't obtain, and can't force.

00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:39.040
Those 2 things are called

00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:40.800
affection

00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:42.800
and sincerity.

00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:46.370
Don't say such strange things.

00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:47.960
It's not strange.

00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:49.520
Actually,

00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:51.170
after I woke up that day,

00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:52.440
I realized

00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:54.540
you were already gone.

00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:56.000
I called you,

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:57.260
but you didn't answer.

00:30:57.880 --> 00:30:58.600
I have no idea

00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:00.040
what you've been busy with these days

00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:01.240
or where you've been.

00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:05.320
I just want to give you the medicine.

00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:08.620
You were very sick that night.

00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:10.920
The doctor prescribed you
a lot of medicine:

00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:11.680
painkillers,

00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:12.440
anti-inflammatory medications,

00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:13.400
and fever reducers.

00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:14.930
You didn't take any of them.

00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:15.720
I guess

00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:17.040
you haven't taken

00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:18.920
a single pill these days, have you?

00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:20.120
Are your old injuries

00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:21.560
still flaring up?

00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:22.770
Do they hurt?

00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:25.680
The doctor told me

00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:27.680
you can't stop taking your medications.

00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:28.440
So

00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:30.560
I just want to give you the medicine box.

00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:31.160
No need.

00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:33.440
Wait.

00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:34.240
Don't go yet!

00:31:57.280 --> 00:31:58.280
The medicine box.

00:31:59.080 --> 00:31:59.840
The medicine box?

00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:00.760
It's in my room.

00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:01.560
I'll go get it now.

00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:02.360
Don't bother.

00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:05.240
It's quite late.

00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:07.280
Tomorrow at 6 a.m.,

00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:08.160
meet me in the study.

00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:09.220
Tomorrow at 6 a.m.?

00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:10.960
I've been very busy lately.

00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:12.510
Mornings are my only free time.

00:32:12.510 --> 00:32:13.040
Okay.

00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:14.080
Then

00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:14.920
