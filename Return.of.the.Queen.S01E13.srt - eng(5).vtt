[Return of the Queen]

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.430
[Episode 13]

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:44.759
Haimeng.

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:46.560
Haimeng.

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:48.120
Wake up.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:49.310
It hurts.

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:50.690
It hurts so much.

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:24.680
It's too bitter.

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.200
I've been taking it for 3 years.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.410
I don't want to take it anymore.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:31.430
Trust me.

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.320
The pain will go away
after you take the medicine.

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:19.079
Doctor.

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:22.240
Her fever has subsided.

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:23.680
All her other vital signs

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.680
have basically returned to normal.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.430
The painkillers you gave her

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:28.829
worked remarkably well.

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:30.750
So she won't be in too much pain, right?

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:31.150
Right.

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.520
[Ward]

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:32.470
This episode has lasted

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:33.280
for quite a while.

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.590
She delayed treatment for too long.

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:35.150
The inflammation

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:36.560
nearly became critical.

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:38.800
Recently, has she experienced

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:39.960
some kind of

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:41.400
major emotional shock?

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.190
As her primary physician,

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:49.190
I must remind you:

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.840
the surgery she had overseas—

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.079
likely due to poor conditions—

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:53.240
was performed poorly.

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:54.400
If she wants to be free from pain,

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.800
she definitely needs another surgery.

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.329
She needs another surgery?

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:58.990
I advised her a few times,

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:00.080
but

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.810
she refused.

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:02.540
If you have the chance,

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.340
it's best if you convince her.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.400
Okay.

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:07.590
Understood.

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:07.910
[Ward]

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:08.970
Thank you, Doctor.

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:41.070
It hurts so much.

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:42.400
It'll be okay.

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:08.720
I'm here.

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:11.410
From now on,

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:14.110
you won't be in pain anymore.

00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:59.560
Honey?

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:03.160
Honey, you're finally back.

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:05.010
Sorry for making you worry.

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:08.090
Alright.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.390
I haven't showered for days.

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:12.190
I smell awful.

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:16.120
I've put your clothes

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:17.520
in the bedroom wardrobe.

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:18.160
Come.

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:19.070
Okay.

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:21.360
Mom.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:32.720
Honey,

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:33.780
come here quickly.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:34.560
Mom.

00:06:39.159 --> 00:06:40.290
You've been through

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:41.530
a lot these days.

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:45.110
It's nothing.

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:46.630
They just kept investigating

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:47.870
and interrogated me many times.

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:48.750
But aside from the footage

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:49.920
from the sanatorium,

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:50.480
they couldn't find

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:51.880
any evidence against me.

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:53.430
We had nothing to do

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:54.870
with Ye Haimeng's mother's death anyway.

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:56.630
Of course they couldn't find any evidence.

00:06:56.630 --> 00:06:57.360
Besides,

00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:59.480
we're after money, not lives.

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:00.480
Right?

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:00.920
Mom.

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:02.160
That's enough.

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:06.800
Now that you're back,

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:08.200
you still need to resolve

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:09.800
some matters

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:11.920
that you handled back then.

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:15.010
What's left to resolve?

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:16.960
Of course there are some.

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:18.160
We've fought with Ye Haimeng

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:19.390
to this point.

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:20.600
Mare Nubium is gone.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.330
Cloud Manor is gone too.

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:23.390
We can't just give up

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:24.190
like this.

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:25.750
Besides,

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:26.920
Ye Haimeng thinks

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:28.720
that after lying low for 3 years,

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:30.470
she has us trapped in her net.

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:32.270
But in this world,

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:34.560
while the mantis stalks the cicada,

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:35.960
the oriole waits behind.

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:37.390
There are many people

00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:38.250
and many things

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:40.650
that she simply can't see through.

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:42.570
Do you understand?

00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:47.000
About Sinan's matter back then,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.190
you still remember how you

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:49.390
cleaned it up, right?

00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:51.970
I remember.

00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:52.830
Now,

00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:53.830
we still have

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:54.830
a hidden card.

00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:55.510
Before we

00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:56.920
play this card,

00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:58.580
we can't afford any mistakes.

00:07:58.720 --> 00:07:59.360
But

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:00.040
that person—

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:01.430
she didn't leave early

00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:02.490
as you instructed.

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:04.120
She showed up

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:05.250
at Sinan's funeral.

00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:06.360
You and Siyue

00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:07.560
go find her.

00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:09.950
Take care of her

00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:12.290
and that child.

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:17.720
Honey.

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:19.430
You rest well today.

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:21.460
We'll go tomorrow afternoon.

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:22.800
Okay.

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:03.320
You're awake.

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:04.670
Mm.

00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:08.870
When did you wake up?

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:11.200
When you were talking in your sleep.

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:13.880
I was talking in my sleep?

00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:15.320
You kept saying,

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:17.530
"It won't hurt anymore.

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:19.770
It won't hurt anymore."

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:21.720
You said it...

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:23.150
about 999 times.

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:25.150
I said it that many times?

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:28.720
It doesn't hurt anymore.

00:09:46.390 --> 00:09:47.150
Haimeng.

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:49.320
Can we...

00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:51.960
stop fighting?

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:54.760
And that day you fainted—

00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:56.390
it really scared me.

00:09:56.390 --> 00:09:58.450
I never want to go through that again.

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:00.560
I don't want to be your enemy.

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:03.480
Haimeng,

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:05.550
can you forgive me

00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:06.120
for all those hurtful things

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:07.320
I said before?

00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:11.960
Lu Siyu,

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:13.870
that day I told you to bring

00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:15.730
the authentication report to me.

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:17.870
Do you hate me?

00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:24.120
That's right.

00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:25.960
I deceived you once.

00:10:26.270 --> 00:10:27.600
You hurt me once.

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:30.360
We're even now.

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:34.670
So you mean

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.200
all our past grudges

00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:37.480
are wiped clean?

00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:40.370
Wiping our grudges clean—

00:10:41.270 --> 00:10:42.930
does that make you this happy?

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:44.790
No.

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:45.840
I just...

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:47.270
I just feel...

00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:48.320
I really should have

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:49.320
told you all those things

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:50.150
earlier.

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:55.620
You're the youngest son of the Lu family.

00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:56.910
I couldn't

00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:59.200
tell you everything

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:00.260
about Sinan and me.

00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:01.600
Even now,

00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:04.030
I still find it hard to believe

00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:05.840
my brother was that kind of person.

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:06.840
I never thought

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:08.360
for the sake of Mare Nubium,

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:09.440
he would...

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:14.180
I can't believe it either.

00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:16.750
The man who once cherished me

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:19.150
and sincerely proposed to me

00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:20.280
actually wished...

00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:22.550
wished that I would never come back.

00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:23.480
So these injuries

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:25.010
were because of my brother?

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:28.720
They were from the car crash

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:30.510
after we left the hotel.

00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:32.000
Was the car crash really an accident?

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.750
According to
the overseas police investigation,

00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:35.350
the truck driver was a local,

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:36.600
with no connection

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:37.150
to Sinan,

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:38.030
the Lu family,

00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:39.360
or anyone else.

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:41.390
That day, due to road repairs and detours,

00:11:41.390 --> 00:11:42.720
he unexpectedly ended up

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:44.120
on the same road as me and Sinan.

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:45.720
After investigating,

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:47.870
the overseas police concluded

00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:49.670
it was an accidental collision.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:50.720
That day, my brother

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:52.150
actually wanted to take you away,

00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:54.210
but the accident happened suddenly.

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:56.320
So my brother

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:57.050
passed away,

00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:58.440
and you survived?

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:00.670
But at the hospital,

00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:01.840
I was surrounded and blocked.

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:02.790
And I saw with my own eyes

00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:04.320
what happened to my family.

00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:05.510
My father died.

took everything from me.

00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:13.120
I was covered in wounds,

00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:15.200
too afraid to come back.

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:21.600
But it's all in the past now.

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:23.530
It's just I still don't understand

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:25.870
why Sinan wanted to kill me.

00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:26.840
Was it really because

00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:28.320
I'm the heir to the Ye family?

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:29.120
Or was someone else

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:30.360
behind all this?

00:12:33.870 --> 00:12:34.870
What if

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:36.600
it was my family?

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:42.540

not despair just yet.

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:53.000
Maybe my brother had

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:54.480
other secrets at Mare Nubium

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:55.600

We've finished the audit,

but the books are too perfect,

00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:06.440

from 3 years earlier than them?

Three years earlier than them?

That's going way back.

00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:05.960
Like this one—

00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:07.030
this is a heavy-poundage bow.

00:20:07.030 --> 00:20:08.760
It's more commonly used by men.

00:20:10.790 --> 00:20:11.680
Why?

00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:12.110
Because

00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:13.440
men and women have

00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:14.480
different muscle strength

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:15.880
and different ways of exerting force.

00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:16.830
So,

00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:18.160
as a long-range weapon,

00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:19.400
it should harmonize
with the archer's strength,

00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:20.400
becoming one with it.

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:21.110
Only then can it achieve

00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:22.110
the best results.

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:27.770

00:20:28.830 --> 00:20:29.960

00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:31.550

00:20:31.550 --> 00:20:32.480

00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:48.160
What's this?

00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:49.200
A gift.

00:20:55.070 --> 00:20:56.310
I specially brought this back

00:20:56.310 --> 00:20:57.270
when I returned to China.

00:20:57.270 --> 00:20:57.920
It's from the same brand

00:20:57.920 --> 00:20:58.920
as my bow.

00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:00.030
Medium draw weight.

00:21:00.030 --> 00:21:00.590

00:21:00.590 --> 00:21:01.270

00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:02.880
were custom-made by hand.

00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:04.000
At that time, I thought

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:05.000
I'd buy it first

00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:07.170
and give it to someone special.

00:21:22.270 --> 00:21:23.720

00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:36.070
Such an expensive gift—

00:21:36.550 --> 00:21:38.160
giving it to me is such a waste.

00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:39.000
Who I give the bow to—

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.000
what matters isn't the bow's value,

00:21:41.310 --> 00:21:43.040
but the person who receives it.

00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:46.880
Even a bow can recognize its master.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:47.640
Now,

00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:49.650
you are its master.
