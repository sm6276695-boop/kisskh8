Yixi.

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:44.864
Yixi, what's wrong?

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.136
Is the demonic energy flaring up?

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:48.832
Yixi.

00:01:49.568 --> 00:01:50.799
Don't shut me out. Let me in.

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:51.744
I can help you.

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.280
Yixi.

00:01:54.519 --> 00:01:55.456
No.

00:01:56.879 --> 00:01:58.959
I don't want you to see me like this.

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:08.120
Yixi.

00:02:09.439 --> 00:02:10.464
Yixi.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.120
Yixi.

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:14.680
I know this isn't your true self.

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:17.039
The Night Deity is our enemy.

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:18.639
Only you can control him.

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.360
Only you can protect everyone.

00:02:22.919 --> 00:02:24.560
Yixi, you're not the Night Deity.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:25.479
You have a home now.

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.280

Don't you want to travel?

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:35.960
I haven't shown you shadow plays.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.479
You've never tried
our kingdom's candied hawthorns.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.680
Yixi, hold on.

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:44.800
Stay strong.

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.064
Yixi.

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:57.632
Yixi.

00:02:58.639 --> 00:02:59.584
Yixi.

00:03:07.919 --> 00:03:08.928
Yixi.

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:19.840
I'm here.

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:27.199
Chen, do you know?

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.879
I've been thinking all this time.

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:33.639
I hated them.

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:38.120
I hated how they
treated me like a monster.

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:40.800
I hated their beatings and curses.

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.039
All their looks were the same.

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.000
If this world is so cruel,

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:49.400
why should I protect them?

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.719
Their lives mean nothing to me.

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.319
But your words

00:03:56.719 --> 00:03:58.439
made me realize
I couldn't lie to myself.

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:01.680
Deep down,

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:05.039
I still yearn for their acceptance.

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:09.340
I still want to live

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:11.639
and protect the Three Realms.

00:04:19.399 --> 00:04:20.360
I'm sorry.

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:22.839
If it weren't for me,

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.319
you wouldn't have become like this.

00:04:27.439 --> 00:04:29.000
You are the Sword Master.

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:32.439
You should've been your parents' pride.

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:34.496
I understand you.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.024
Yixi.

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:38.784
I'm right here.

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.279
Right here with you.

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:02.336
Take a sip.

00:05:05.079 --> 00:05:06.879
It might calm the symptoms.

00:05:16.519 --> 00:05:17.568
Another sip.

00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:18.688
One more,

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:20.352
and it'll subside.

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:30.560
Better now?

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:37.079
- Stop!
- Stop!

00:05:37.568 --> 00:05:38.620
Wan Guchen,

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:40.120
you brought this evil deity back,

00:05:40.779 --> 00:05:43.000
plunging Wanfeng into grave danger.

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:44.899
The Emperor is furious.

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:46.368
You

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:47.779
have nowhere to run.

00:05:48.779 --> 00:05:49.620
Wan Guchen,

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:51.379
surrender quietly.

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:53.056
We will

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:55.420
grant you an intact corpse.

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:58.620
Yixi, don't be afraid.

00:06:28.259 --> 00:06:29.280
Yixi.

00:06:30.339 --> 00:06:31.660
Don't let the deity take over.

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:05.472
Yixi.

00:07:06.379 --> 00:07:07.459
Stop this!

00:07:07.459 --> 00:07:08.620
No more senseless killing!

00:07:08.899 --> 00:07:09.740
Don't kill me!

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:11.379
Tell her to spare me!

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:13.139
Guchen.

00:07:13.139 --> 00:07:14.939
I'm your own uncle!

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:17.180
From now on,

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:18.819
I won't compete with you for anything.

00:07:19.259 --> 00:07:21.139
Just make her spare my life!

00:07:21.339 --> 00:07:22.180
Guchen.

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:23.759
Yixi, come down now!

00:07:23.779 --> 00:07:25.079
He's no threat to us.

00:07:25.699 --> 00:07:26.660
Come down!

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:54.379
You cursed creature!

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:55.648
How dare you return?

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:56.680
You sinner!

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:57.888
Get out!

00:07:58.740 --> 00:07:59.660
Get out!

00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:00.980
You walking calamity!

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:02.899
How dare you come?

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:05.100
This is all your doing!

00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:07.339
I'm sorry.

00:08:07.699 --> 00:08:09.459
Give my wife back!

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:10.759
Return my mother!

00:08:10.839 --> 00:08:12.160
Why didn't you die instead?

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:13.952
Mother.

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:15.399
Get lost, you jinx!

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:17.000
Get out!

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:19.920
You're the eternal sinner
of our kingdom!

00:08:20.079 --> 00:08:23.120
May you suffer
through endless lifetimes!

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:25.600
- Die miserably!
- Get out now!

00:08:27.079 --> 00:08:28.279
Scram!

00:08:34.679 --> 00:08:35.799
Don't touch my Xiaochuan!

00:08:37.799 --> 00:08:38.784
I'm sorry.

00:08:39.456 --> 00:08:40.416
I'm sorry.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.200
Sorry won't fix anything!

00:08:44.259 --> 00:08:45.340
My Xiaochuan

00:08:45.919 --> 00:08:48.279
was choked to death.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.279
He was so young.

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:52.279
So kind-hearted.

00:08:52.919 --> 00:08:54.840
What did he do wrong?

00:08:55.519 --> 00:08:57.000
What did he do wrong?

00:09:00.879 --> 00:09:03.039
Mother, I don't think he's evil.

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:05.799
Having a demon sealed inside is sad.

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:07.919
You won't kill anyone, right?

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:12.440
Xiaochuan's dead.

00:09:12.659 --> 00:09:14.139
I won't live either.

00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:17.344
It's you two

00:09:18.019 --> 00:09:20.019
who killed us both!

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:21.600
Even as a ghost,

00:09:22.039 --> 00:09:23.879
I'll haunt you beyond death!

00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:27.200
Heavens above!

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:31.240
Why didn't they die instead?

00:09:38.399 --> 00:09:39.519
Your unfilial grandson

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.000
pays respects to you.

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:46.000
Get up.

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:47.872
Get up.

00:09:51.399 --> 00:09:52.480
Guchen,

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:54.400
now,

00:09:54.519 --> 00:09:55.799
our kingdom

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:57.840
suffers heavy casualties.

00:09:57.919 --> 00:09:59.480
How can I

00:09:59.639 --> 00:10:01.720
remain as the king?

00:10:02.279 --> 00:10:03.360
I'm guilty.

00:10:03.679 --> 00:10:04.720
Let me atone with death!

00:10:06.519 --> 00:10:07.552
Grandfather.

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:09.856
Grandfather.

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:13.399
My time grows short.

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:15.799
But our kingdom

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:17.799
faces imminent peril.

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:19.799
The people's survival

00:10:21.039 --> 00:10:21.984
now rests

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:24.419
solely on you.

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:26.976
Guchen,

00:10:28.279 --> 00:10:30.200
swear

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:32.879
to save our kingdom,

00:10:33.519 --> 00:10:36.360
to save these countless innocent lives.

00:10:42.679 --> 00:10:44.080
I swear it, Grandfather.

00:11:43.919 --> 00:11:44.992
Yixi.

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:49.152
Did I

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:51.799
do all these?

00:11:53.759 --> 00:11:54.688
No.

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:56.279
This isn't your fault.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.000
Yixi.

00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:12.220
Wherever you go,

00:12:13.759 --> 00:12:14.720
I'll stay by your side.

00:12:24.879 --> 00:12:26.080
You once promised

00:12:27.879 --> 00:12:30.120
to show me all life's joys.

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:34.960
If I could choose one thing,

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:38.139
I'd marry you.

00:12:41.399 --> 00:12:42.240
Alright.

00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:46.000
We'll hold the ceremony now.

00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:49.280
Yes.

You were rigorously selected
by the Nine Heavens as the Sword Master,

but you'd throw

you can die then.

numerous Night Clan members
active near Wanyingzhou.

We suspect

00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:27.180
they've established a stronghold there.

00:20:27.539 --> 00:20:31.900
We request
your intervention in this matter.

Excuse me,

00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:04.319
could you show me the way out?

00:21:05.039 --> 00:21:06.359
I can't find it.

00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:08.319
And my ankle's sprained.

00:21:09.039 --> 00:21:10.240

are you alone here?

00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:23.299
My father abandoned us when I was young.

00:21:24.279 --> 00:21:25.859
My mother and I relied on each other.

00:21:26.619 --> 00:21:27.619
But then

00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:30.099
she fell gravely ill

00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:31.488
and left me.

00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:33.240

00:21:34.119 --> 00:21:35.319
We know the way.

00:21:35.319 --> 00:21:36.256
Come with us.

00:21:36.759 --> 00:21:38.039
Yes, we'll guide you.

00:21:39.359 --> 00:21:40.279
Thank you.

00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:41.696

00:21:58.119 --> 00:21:59.960
Why does the mist keep thickening?

00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:04.759

00:22:27.559 --> 00:22:29.079
I'm pleased.

00:22:29.728 --> 00:22:30.759

00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:37.079
Weren't you eager earlier?

00:22:38.119 --> 00:22:39.640
Why run now?

00:22:53.279 --> 00:22:54.559
Such potent vital energy.

00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:56.768
As expected,

00:22:57.599 --> 00:22:59.119
men's vile desires

00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:01.359

Help!

00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:21.559
Is there anyone?

00:23:21.799 --> 00:23:22.680
Is there anyone?

00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:55.440
How should I know

00:23:56.079 --> 00:23:57.180
how they died?

00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:00.119
Why not

00:24:01.839 --> 00:24:03.420
join them?

00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:11.240
It's you causing trouble here.

00:24:13.119 --> 00:24:14.400
You're an immortal.

00:24:15.559 --> 00:24:17.000
No wonder I couldn't harm you.

00:24:19.079 --> 00:24:20.680
You are quite attractive.

00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:22.619
It'd be a shame

00:24:23.039 --> 00:24:24.032
to let you die.

00:24:25.039 --> 00:24:26.720
Why not let me enjoy you first?

00:24:28.119 --> 00:24:29.400
How dare you!

00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:31.559
Do you know who I am?

00:24:34.319 --> 00:24:36.279
Quite decent.

00:24:37.079 --> 00:24:38.279
How interesting.

00:24:40.319 --> 00:24:42.880
The more you push me away,

00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:46.319
the more intrigued I become.

00:24:48.799 --> 00:24:50.279
Let me see

00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:52.240
what you'll look like

00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:54.339
after breaking your rules.

00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:03.339
I'm afraid you'll be disappointed.

00:25:03.599 --> 00:25:05.559
You grow more fascinating by the minute.

00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:08.000
My name is Bai Chuli.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.216
Your name?

00:25:15.319 --> 00:25:16.359
Stop causing trouble.

00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:20.880
If you don't want me to do that,

00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:23.599
let's make a deal.

00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:26.359
Stay by my side forever,

00:25:27.279 --> 00:25:28.440
and I'll stop harming people.

00:25:29.039 --> 00:25:29.952
Deal?

00:25:30.799 --> 00:25:33.079
I've never seen someone so shameless.

00:25:34.819 --> 00:25:35.900
If you harm anyone again,

00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:37.859
I won't spare you.

00:25:39.779 --> 00:25:41.779
I've seen countless men's eyes.

00:25:42.779 --> 00:25:43.740
You can't fool me.

00:25:45.180 --> 00:25:47.059
You're clearly attracted to me.

00:25:50.579 --> 00:25:51.579
But that's fine.

00:25:52.460 --> 00:25:53.980
I enjoy challenges.

00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:01.420
Why are you here?

00:26:02.420 --> 00:26:05.180
That woman was the former Bai Yixi.

00:26:05.579 --> 00:26:07.259
So you found her after all.

00:26:07.819 --> 00:26:09.259
I've waited for 300 years.

00:26:11.619 --> 00:26:13.299
Now, I've finally found her.

00:26:14.140 --> 00:26:17.339
But do you know the Night Deity
still resides within her?

00:26:18.019 --> 00:26:19.660
When the Night Deity's power awakens,

00:26:20.059 --> 00:26:22.460
you must kill her
to protect the Three Realms.

00:26:25.059 --> 00:26:25.900
What did you say?

00:26:28.940 --> 00:26:30.940
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

00:26:32.859 --> 00:26:34.660
If I'd told you,

00:26:34.660 --> 00:26:37.700
you might not have waited for 300 years

00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:39.619
to kill the Night Deity again.

00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:40.980
If that's the case,

00:26:41.819 --> 00:26:43.460
I refuse to be the Sword Master.

00:26:44.539 --> 00:26:45.819
I won't harm her.

00:26:46.460 --> 00:26:47.819
This is her destiny.

00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:50.859
You can abandon your position.

00:26:51.099 --> 00:26:52.619
Others will take the role.

00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:55.059
She'll still die regardless.

00:27:00.099 --> 00:27:01.460
I've said my piece.

00:27:02.380 --> 00:27:03.539
Consider the implications

00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:05.859
carefully.

00:27:09.779 --> 00:27:10.720
Why?

00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:14.180
Why must it be this way?

00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:18.740
(Perhaps your greatest wish)

00:27:19.779 --> 00:27:21.740
(was to live freely and joyfully)

00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:25.220
(even if the ending
would remain unchanged.)

00:27:26.619 --> 00:27:28.339
(But I can't face you again.)

00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:29.859
(I can't kill you again.)

00:27:31.259 --> 00:27:32.940
(I won't let you endure the pain)

00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:35.539
(of being parted from the beloved.)

00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:42.880
Here you go, sir.

00:27:44.119 --> 00:27:45.059
This is yours.

00:27:47.579 --> 00:27:49.779
- Good.
- Good.

00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:51.680
Here, coming.

00:27:58.880 --> 00:27:59.904
Here you are.

00:28:05.599 --> 00:28:06.720
Madam Yu.

00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:11.079
You're here, Mr. Shiyi.

00:28:11.759 --> 00:28:13.160
What would you like?

00:28:13.799 --> 00:28:17.119
I'll take her tonight.

00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:19.400
No problem, Mr. Shiyi.

00:28:19.559 --> 00:28:21.359
She's yours this evening.

00:28:25.599 --> 00:28:26.680
- Good.
- Good.

00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:28.440
- Good.
- Good.

00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:40.416
Beautiful one.

00:28:40.512 --> 00:28:41.536
Quickly!

00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:44.160
Why so late?

00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:47.519
You kept me waiting.

00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:52.039
The finest things require patience.

00:28:55.599 --> 00:28:56.736
What are you...?

00:28:58.319 --> 00:28:59.599
So mischievous.

00:29:05.839 --> 00:29:07.160
Beauty.

00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:10.279
Don't waste the night.

00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:13.680
Let's get to bed quickly.

00:29:15.359 --> 00:29:17.160
Are you a monster?

00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:20.119
Mr. Shiyi.

00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:22.079
Have you forgotten me so soon?

00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:25.759
You personally chose me moments ago.

00:29:25.799 --> 00:29:26.640
I...

00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:28.480
I know nothing.

00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:48.768
Help!

00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:49.720
Help!

00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:51.559
Why is it you?

00:29:51.559 --> 00:29:52.680
So it's you.

00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:55.200
Seems fate truly binds us.

00:29:55.519 --> 00:29:56.759
Weren't you in Wanyingzhou?

00:29:57.960 --> 00:29:59.160
It's all for you.

00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:03.039
To find you,

00:30:03.279 --> 00:30:04.720
I've searched everywhere.

00:30:05.559 --> 00:30:07.160
How else would we meet again so soon?

00:30:07.660 --> 00:30:09.299
You promised to harm no one.

00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:10.688
Unforgivable.

00:30:13.559 --> 00:30:15.039
True. I did say that.

00:30:16.079 --> 00:30:17.279
But on one condition.

00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:19.480
You must stay by my side.

00:30:23.319 --> 00:30:24.599
Have you forgotten?

00:30:27.559 --> 00:30:28.512
So

00:30:29.359 --> 00:30:30.799
you're the one who killed them.

00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:36.480
Twisting logic.

00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:38.048
Shamelessly unrepentant.

00:30:41.599 --> 00:30:43.000
You think I won't kill you?

00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:46.160
How ridiculous.

00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:48.200
I am a member of the Night Clan,

00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:50.400
feeding on human desires.

00:30:51.359 --> 00:30:53.960
If they had all been noble like you,

00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:55.839
I couldn't have slain them.

00:30:59.599 --> 00:31:00.599
But you...

00:31:01.839 --> 00:31:04.559
As an Upper Immortal
who specializes in hunting our clan,

00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:08.000
why haven't you killed me yet?

00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:10.839
Unless

00:31:12.279 --> 00:31:13.519
you can't bear to do it.

00:31:15.136 --> 00:31:16.279
You...

00:31:16.279 --> 00:31:17.312
What?

00:31:18.119 --> 00:31:19.168
Speak.
