(Sponsored by)

00:00:58.138 --> 00:01:01.148
(This is a work of fiction)

00:01:04.548 --> 00:01:05.548
Hey!

00:01:05.988 --> 00:01:09.088
Shut that dog up!

00:01:09.488 --> 00:01:12.088
My kid's studying, so keep it down!

00:01:12.525 --> 00:01:13.525
Hey!

00:01:13.925 --> 00:01:17.035
- You jerk! - At least three times a day,

00:01:17.435 --> 00:01:19.665
during roughly 35 years of our working lives,

00:01:20.035 --> 00:01:23.035
we face about 40,000 conflicts, big and small.

00:01:23.035 --> 00:01:24.535
Move your car. Why are you making such a scene?

00:01:24.605 --> 00:01:26.745
The moment people can't contain their anger,

00:01:27.245 --> 00:01:29.975
- Hey! - disputes and fights break out.

00:01:29.975 --> 00:01:31.585
In those hair-trigger moments,

00:01:32.615 --> 00:01:34.545
it's best to read the room and walk away.

00:01:35.415 --> 00:01:36.855
That's what Mr. Shin said.

00:01:40.125 --> 00:01:42.925
Are you looking down on me because I have a tiny shop?

00:01:43.195 --> 00:01:44.355
Just take it all back!

00:01:44.425 --> 00:01:46.595
Fine, I'll just stop getting my supplies from you.

00:01:46.595 --> 00:01:50.135
How dare that old hag point at me? I've let things slide for a regular.

00:01:50.195 --> 00:01:51.805
Pay me what you owe right now.

00:01:51.805 --> 00:01:55.135
Who are you to call me an old hag? You have no right to call me that.

00:01:55.205 --> 00:01:56.935
When did I talk to you like that?

00:01:57.275 --> 00:02:00.075
If you take someone's goods, you have to pay for them, right?

00:02:00.075 --> 00:02:01.675
You've got to be kidding me.

00:02:03.015 --> 00:02:06.585
Mr. Shin!

00:02:07.685 --> 00:02:10.715
Go to the police station and get the police.

00:02:11.115 --> 00:02:15.795
He keeps leaving junk in my store. All he gives me is worthless trash!

00:02:15.855 --> 00:02:17.655
And now he's trying to play dumb about it!

00:02:17.725 --> 00:02:20.065
And that's an excuse to not pay for three months?

00:02:20.295 --> 00:02:22.765
Call the cops or whoever you want! Let's see who comes out on top!

00:02:22.835 --> 00:02:25.335
Okay, you just wait! He's making the call!

00:02:25.335 --> 00:02:26.335
- Hello? - What?

00:02:26.405 --> 00:02:27.735
Is this the Namhyung Foods head office?

00:02:28.375 --> 00:02:32.545
I'd like to ask a question. I'm a loyal customer of your milk,

00:02:32.705 --> 00:02:35.075
but it seems the local distributor...

00:02:35.215 --> 00:02:38.445
is supplying items that are about to expire.

00:02:38.585 --> 00:02:39.845
Can you tell me what's going on?

00:02:40.785 --> 00:02:41.985
- Excuse me? - Well...

00:02:42.055 --> 00:02:43.055
The distributor's name?

00:02:43.115 --> 00:02:45.685
(Maheon-dong Distributor)

00:02:45.755 --> 00:02:47.785
Sir, you're the Maheon-dong distributor, right?

00:02:49.495 --> 00:02:51.625
When did I ever give her expired products?

00:02:51.625 --> 00:02:53.865
When did I say you gave her expired products?

00:02:54.365 --> 00:02:56.535
I said they only had a few days left.

00:02:58.195 --> 00:03:00.505
Hello? They hung up.

00:03:02.705 --> 00:03:04.775
(Ttoli Super)

00:03:04.835 --> 00:03:06.275
Oh, Attorney Oh.

00:03:06.345 --> 00:03:08.375
Let me ask you something.

00:03:08.645 --> 00:03:11.745
A friend of mine bought some goods on credit,

00:03:11.815 --> 00:03:15.585
but she's three months behind. What's the best course of action?

00:03:16.455 --> 00:03:17.455
Debt collection?

00:03:18.015 --> 00:03:19.025
Oh my goodness.

00:03:20.355 --> 00:03:21.355
A provisional seizure.

00:03:21.585 --> 00:03:24.225
- Oh, that thing. - That's horrible.

00:03:24.225 --> 00:03:26.865
You mean they put seizure notices on the goods so they can't be sold?

00:03:27.795 --> 00:03:30.035
What? What seizure notices?

00:03:31.265 --> 00:03:32.965
This guy must have had some spoiled milk.

00:03:33.635 --> 00:03:35.705
Calling me this early in the morning just to talk nonsense.

00:03:35.775 --> 00:03:37.035
Okay. Got it.

00:03:37.575 --> 00:03:40.075
Hey, how long have you known this guy?

00:03:40.145 --> 00:03:41.915
We've been doing business for over ten years.

00:03:41.975 --> 00:03:45.185
You should take this chance to pay what you owe and cut ties with him.

00:03:45.345 --> 00:03:48.185
He'll be fired by corporate anyway.

00:03:48.385 --> 00:03:49.815
What?

00:03:50.285 --> 00:03:54.325
And you, sir, instead of causing a ruckus here,

00:03:54.525 --> 00:03:57.995
you should just sue her. That's the cleanest way.

00:03:58.055 --> 00:04:01.795
Like you said, it's not like the products are expired,

00:04:01.935 --> 00:04:05.135
and there's still time left, so if you sue,

00:04:05.435 --> 00:04:07.665
you should be able to collect on your unpaid balance right away.

00:04:07.905 --> 00:04:11.535
Come on, it's not enough money to go to court over.

00:04:11.605 --> 00:04:13.875
But him getting fired seems a bit harsh.

00:04:13.945 --> 00:04:16.575
Your son just got into college this year.

00:04:16.645 --> 00:04:17.715
Why are you worried about that?

00:04:17.775 --> 00:04:21.245
Gosh, I have kids of my own, so of course I'm worried.

00:04:21.315 --> 00:04:26.125
Unbelievable. You were about to kill each other.

00:04:26.285 --> 00:04:30.255
Fine, I'm out of it then. Shake hands and make up, or don't.

00:04:30.425 --> 00:04:31.765
Just make up.

00:04:32.195 --> 00:04:34.665
- You don't sue someone you know. - Right.

00:04:34.725 --> 00:04:35.735
Right, you know each other.

00:04:35.795 --> 00:04:38.665
Stop making a scene and just shake on it already.

00:04:38.735 --> 00:04:41.065
- You don't sue your neighbours. - That's right.

00:04:41.135 --> 00:04:44.135
- Oh, honestly. - Make up.

00:04:44.135 --> 00:04:46.705
- If you have any fresh produce, - Let's go.

00:04:46.775 --> 00:04:49.145
make sure she's your first delivery.

00:04:49.575 --> 00:04:52.715
And if you have any extras, give them to Ttori Super first.

00:04:53.185 --> 00:04:54.385
And you.

00:04:54.615 --> 00:04:58.215
If you owe me anything, pay your tab on time.

00:04:59.185 --> 00:05:03.155
Everyone here knows you're loaded. Hey, kid, you know it too, right?

00:05:03.225 --> 00:05:04.825
- Yes. - Right.

00:05:04.895 --> 00:05:08.865
As long as the produce is good, I always pay right on the spot.

00:05:09.235 --> 00:05:11.235
I'm not the type to stiff someone on a bill.

00:05:11.805 --> 00:05:15.335
It's not like I did it on purpose. Sunshine Mart in the next town...

00:05:15.405 --> 00:05:18.005
keeps placing huge orders and then cancelling.

00:05:18.305 --> 00:05:19.375
So I'm left with all this extra stock.

00:05:19.445 --> 00:05:23.315
Meat processed in unsanitary places with no regard for standards,

00:05:23.845 --> 00:05:26.485
and food made with ingredients that are no longer fresh,

00:05:26.845 --> 00:05:29.485
- are being sold unregulated. - Let's see.

00:05:29.555 --> 00:05:32.485
- A cramped, airless workshop... - Goodness.

00:05:32.585 --> 00:05:34.955
In a place with inadequate sanitary management...

00:05:35.025 --> 00:05:37.395
What a son of a wench.

00:05:38.125 --> 00:05:40.465
People who mess with the food we eat like that,

00:05:40.525 --> 00:05:43.495
they should have every single one of their fingers broken.

00:05:43.495 --> 00:05:45.135
You watch this show too?

00:05:45.205 --> 00:05:49.835
Yeah, it's pretty good. I watch this, dramas and reruns.

00:05:50.805 --> 00:05:51.805
Here, two dollars.

00:05:51.875 --> 00:05:54.305
- How it ends up in our markets... - Mr. Shin.

00:05:54.405 --> 00:05:56.515
- What? - and who's behind those...

00:05:56.615 --> 00:05:57.845
A little something extra!

00:05:58.115 --> 00:05:59.115
You might be carelessly...

00:06:01.415 --> 00:06:02.855
You really are the best.

00:06:02.915 --> 00:06:06.025
Oh, honestly. Thank you so much for today.

00:06:06.085 --> 00:06:09.025
- Sure. - On-Site Pursuit starts now.

00:06:09.155 --> 00:06:11.025
(By your side, sharing happiness)

00:06:11.095 --> 00:06:13.065
(Your neighbour, HI Group)

00:06:15.395 --> 00:06:18.605
(Ttori Super)

00:06:22.105 --> 00:06:26.805
(Shin's Project)

00:06:29.045 --> 00:06:31.515
- It stings. - What on earth happened to you two?

00:06:32.185 --> 00:06:35.085
- Did you two fight? - I do not fight.

00:06:36.815 --> 00:06:39.125
You can tell he can't fight just by looking at him.

00:06:40.185 --> 00:06:43.625
I graduated top of my police class. I have a 3rd-degree Taekwondo belt.

00:06:46.695 --> 00:06:49.595
It's not that I can't fight. I choose not to.

00:06:50.895 --> 00:06:52.235
What did you say?

00:06:52.305 --> 00:06:55.435
Police university valedictorian. He's just bragging.

00:06:56.735 --> 00:06:57.735
What a show-off.

00:06:57.805 --> 00:07:00.745
When was I bragging? I was just stating a fact.

00:07:00.845 --> 00:07:01.845
So was I.

00:07:03.675 --> 00:07:04.675
Goodness.

00:07:05.815 --> 00:07:08.755
But aren't you calling the cops?

00:07:08.815 --> 00:07:10.215
It's obvious they're backed by someone.

00:07:10.285 --> 00:07:14.555
If we call the cops, the plate on the truck is probably fake...

00:07:14.625 --> 00:07:16.255
and the driver's long gone.

00:07:16.325 --> 00:07:19.725
Still, we can't just let this go. That was attempted murder.

00:07:19.795 --> 00:07:24.735
Who says I'm letting it go? I never let bad guys get away.

00:07:25.765 --> 00:07:29.305
I'm going to put them in misery.

00:07:31.705 --> 00:07:32.705
Now,

00:07:33.245 --> 00:07:36.445
I risked my life to get this.

00:07:36.775 --> 00:07:37.775
This is it.

00:07:38.845 --> 00:07:40.415
I'm busy as hell.

00:07:41.515 --> 00:07:46.125
What is it? I told you, no deliveries before 6.

00:07:46.525 --> 00:07:47.655
Seriously.

00:07:50.125 --> 00:07:51.655
(No Memory Card)

00:08:14.385 --> 00:08:15.385
What?

00:08:15.985 --> 00:08:18.155
- What is it? - No, it's just...

00:08:18.925 --> 00:08:21.225
Aren't those the guys who showed up at the convenience store?

00:08:24.925 --> 00:08:25.925
Hold on.

00:08:27.795 --> 00:08:28.795
Right.

00:08:30.735 --> 00:08:33.835
- It is. It's him. - Let me see.

00:08:38.205 --> 00:08:40.105
Couldn't we find them by tracing this license plate?

00:08:40.345 --> 00:08:42.575
- Let's take this to the police. - Pillip.

00:08:43.475 --> 00:08:45.815
They're trying to kick out the locals to build a resort...

00:08:45.885 --> 00:08:48.585
run us over with a truck.

00:08:49.015 --> 00:08:51.715
And they do it all without getting their own hands dirty.

00:08:52.025 --> 00:08:54.325
This is impossible without someone powerful backing them.

00:08:54.625 --> 00:08:57.295
How can you investigate if you don't know who's pulling the strings?

00:08:58.055 --> 00:08:59.865
Do you know what's scarier than the law?

00:09:00.365 --> 00:09:01.465
What? Your fists?

00:09:03.835 --> 00:09:05.765
To me, nothing is scarier than the law.

00:09:05.865 --> 00:09:07.665
That's your problem, kid.

00:09:08.605 --> 00:09:11.135
What's so wrong with living by law and order?

00:09:11.235 --> 00:09:14.075
The problem is that you don't even see the problem.

00:09:20.945 --> 00:09:22.255
Let me see it too.

00:09:23.685 --> 00:09:25.115
I really think it's a match.

00:09:28.725 --> 00:09:32.165
Like I said, he's out on patrol. He's not in.

00:09:32.795 --> 00:09:33.925
I'm hanging up now.

00:09:35.435 --> 00:09:36.595
What, is it that guy again?

00:09:37.195 --> 00:09:39.935
I'll handle it, sir.

00:09:42.605 --> 00:09:44.075
This is Maheon Police, Seobu Substation.

00:09:46.175 --> 00:09:48.875
Listen. I told you, he's out on patrol.

00:09:49.145 --> 00:09:51.345
You're making things very difficult for me.

00:09:53.115 --> 00:09:54.785
I've got the phone. What do you want?

00:09:55.655 --> 00:09:59.285
Hey, you little punk. Who do you think you are?

00:09:59.355 --> 00:10:03.625
Officer Choi? You think this cop's a pushover,

00:10:03.695 --> 00:10:07.865
but I'm a Senior Police Officer. The Captain and I came up together.

00:10:08.595 --> 00:10:09.665
What?

00:10:11.595 --> 00:10:15.675
I'm coming to your house right now, so you'd better not go anywhere.

00:10:16.005 --> 00:10:18.605
I'm going to throw you in jail for obstruction of justice.

00:10:18.945 --> 00:10:22.545
You get out, I'll throw you back in. Get out again. I'll do it again.

00:10:22.545 --> 00:10:25.645
And for the rest of my career, until the day I retire,

00:10:25.915 --> 00:10:28.415
if you so much as step one foot over the crosswalk line,

00:10:28.485 --> 00:10:32.485
I'll bury you in fines and jail. Understand?

00:10:32.555 --> 00:10:33.555
Got it?

00:10:35.455 --> 00:10:36.455
Unbelievable.

00:10:43.535 --> 00:10:45.905
- How can I help you? - Hi.

00:10:52.105 --> 00:10:53.545
What are you doing here?

00:11:02.855 --> 00:11:06.025
I didn't realise you were working at a substation.

00:11:08.055 --> 00:11:09.925
Well, you know, one thing led to another.

00:11:11.295 --> 00:11:13.695
It's already been 15 years.

00:11:13.765 --> 00:11:15.965
Is it because of what happened back then?

00:11:17.265 --> 00:11:18.365
I suppose so.

00:11:19.635 --> 00:11:21.905
It wasn't your fault, Senior Police Officer Choi.

00:11:22.905 --> 00:11:25.035
Please, just call me Detective Choi.

00:11:25.545 --> 00:11:28.305
On second thought, I'm not a detective anymore.

00:11:28.745 --> 00:11:31.875
- Just call me Officer Choi, then. - But just a minute ago,

00:11:32.215 --> 00:11:36.115
you said you were Sr. Officer Choi, and came up with the Captain.

00:11:36.315 --> 00:11:41.085
There's a guy who calls us when he's drunk.

00:11:41.155 --> 00:11:45.595
But he calls every single day instead of sleeping at home.

00:11:45.665 --> 00:11:48.665
He just throws fit, and I was too angry before.

00:11:50.835 --> 00:11:52.505
Anyway, what brings you here?

00:11:53.465 --> 00:11:56.005
I'll get straight to the point.

00:11:56.735 --> 00:11:58.375
I have a favour to ask you, Detective Choi.

00:12:01.475 --> 00:12:04.615
I'd like to ask you to run a background check on this guy.

00:12:19.165 --> 00:12:20.595
Run a background check on this man.

00:12:22.025 --> 00:12:23.535
Yes, sir.

He agreed.

Kim Young Ho has agreed to settle. It must be because of your file.

00:13:11.545 --> 00:13:14.915
Because of his show, merchants left and the resort is being built.

00:13:15.815 --> 00:13:18.555
So he's not entirely without a conscience.

00:13:19.385 --> 00:13:20.855
You have the settlement agreement ready, right?

Yes. It's perfect, right down to the last period.

- Good. Hurry up and go. - Aren't you coming with me?

I've got something to take care of.

Hey, you took the money without even knowing who it was from?

No, an older guy I know just said if I filmed a video and sent it to him,

00:14:54.545 --> 00:14:56.685
he'd cover the security deposit for a shop in Seoul.

I'm telling you, I had no idea it would be on the news.

Unbelievable.

00:15:00.825 --> 00:15:04.855
I feel so sorry for that poor woman, suffering because of a bum like you.

but she says she'll keep at it until I get married.

She must be alive until then, right? She's all I have.

00:15:26.715 --> 00:15:29.885
Then you should've taken over the business for her, you punk.

Yes, here are the settlement papers. Are you going to the courthouse now?

No. That's for the merchants.

00:16:13.895 --> 00:16:16.065

00:23:54.948 --> 00:23:57.918
Oh, you mean the leak of the resort development plans?

00:23:59.328 --> 00:24:02.588
You don't have to worry about that. The contract is legally sound,

00:24:02.698 --> 00:24:05.898
and besides, projects like this take years anyway.

00:24:06.568 --> 00:24:07.898
There's no evidence. None at all.

00:24:08.168 --> 00:24:11.068
Shouldn't you start planning for your kids' studies abroad?

00:24:11.068 --> 00:24:12.908
Thank you.

00:24:13.408 --> 00:24:16.678
Oh, and I've booked dinner with Mr. Mayor for this week.

00:24:16.738 --> 00:24:17.738
Good.

00:24:18.308 --> 00:24:20.608
Here you are, Mr. Mayor.

00:24:21.248 --> 00:24:24.018
I look forward to working with you.

00:24:24.318 --> 00:24:25.418
Don't mention it.

00:24:25.678 --> 00:24:27.618
I'm the one who should be asking for your support.

00:24:28.188 --> 00:24:31.158
Thanks to HI Group, our Gangchun City...

00:24:31.918 --> 00:24:34.458
is being reborn as a tourism and leisure hub.

00:24:34.488 --> 00:24:38.728
- To Gangchun City and HI Group! - Cheers!

00:24:49.208 --> 00:24:50.778
Hi. What is it?

00:24:55.008 --> 00:24:58.248
- What's wrong? - Sir.

00:25:00.588 --> 00:25:02.918
Plagued by corruption from the start,

00:25:02.918 --> 00:25:04.818
the Gangchun Resort project.

00:25:05.118 --> 00:25:08.258
Now that the web of corruption and its masterminds have been exposed!

00:25:08.958 --> 00:25:10.898
We, the producers of On-Site Pursuit,

00:25:11.328 --> 00:25:14.428
will hunt down every last piece of the truth...

00:25:14.528 --> 00:25:17.368
and ensure those responsible are held accountable.

00:25:17.368 --> 00:25:20.308
So, was there anything you found strange...

00:25:20.368 --> 00:25:22.608
or suspicious at all?

00:25:22.738 --> 00:25:24.838
They usually offer a premium on top.

00:25:25.078 --> 00:25:27.608
My goodness, look at this ungrateful brat.

00:25:28.108 --> 00:25:29.648
Kids these days...

00:25:30.178 --> 00:25:31.918
should be punished.

00:25:31.918 --> 00:25:32.918
Hey.

00:25:33.518 --> 00:25:35.088
Oh Jin Ho told everything.

00:25:35.148 --> 00:25:37.758
We have witnesses and evidence, so come along quietly.

00:25:37.818 --> 00:25:40.588
You punk. Who do you think I am?

00:25:40.658 --> 00:25:42.528
- Let go of me! - Hey, he's making a run for it!

00:25:42.588 --> 00:25:44.958
Get that punk!

00:25:44.958 --> 00:25:48.198
Last February, we received a tip...

00:25:48.198 --> 00:25:52.738
about the moggot seafood and later aired a report about it.

00:25:52.968 --> 00:25:57.638
While we meant to raise awareness of poor food distribution,

00:25:57.838 --> 00:26:00.678
we have recently discovered...

00:26:01.078 --> 00:26:02.818
that the evidence and the tip...

00:26:03.518 --> 00:26:04.618
were fabricated.

00:26:05.748 --> 00:26:07.518
Due to our team's negligence,

00:26:07.588 --> 00:26:11.218
to the merchants who suffered irreparable pain and damage,

00:26:11.458 --> 00:26:14.328
we once again offer our deepest apologies.

00:26:17.628 --> 00:26:20.998
Furthermore, to ensure this never happens again,

00:26:21.068 --> 00:26:23.668
we will be fully responsible...

00:26:23.668 --> 00:26:24.968
- We make this solemn promise. - He's amazing.

00:26:25.938 --> 00:26:26.968
We promise.

00:26:29.068 --> 00:26:32.508
What's so cool about him? That guy is so arrogant.

00:26:33.178 --> 00:26:36.318
- But he is amazing. - That doesn't excuse arrogance.

00:26:36.318 --> 00:26:38.248
Oh, don't be so petty.

00:26:38.378 --> 00:26:42.288
Give credit where credit is due. He produces such an incredible show.

00:26:42.448 --> 00:26:45.588
No, Mr. Shin and I are incredible. We caught the culprit for them.

00:26:45.588 --> 00:26:47.088
- Unbelievable. - What?

00:26:47.088 --> 00:26:48.358
You can't see me on screen, but...

00:26:48.428 --> 00:26:50.958
I'm telling you, I was really there! Right, Mr. Shin?

00:26:51.898 --> 00:26:54.098
You took a soda from here, didn't you?

00:26:54.628 --> 00:26:56.438
- What? - You drank it, right?

00:26:56.838 --> 00:26:58.338
I only had one.

00:26:58.398 --> 00:27:01.408
- I'm docking you two dollars. - Come on.

00:27:03.938 --> 00:27:06.308
But I'm telling you, I was really there.

00:27:08.448 --> 00:27:10.018
Okay, so this key...

00:27:10.478 --> 00:27:12.748
should be placed facing this way.

00:27:15.618 --> 00:27:17.888
- This way? - Yes.

00:27:22.328 --> 00:27:27.498
So was there anything you found odd or suspicious?

00:27:27.828 --> 00:27:32.538
I think I saw something. Something about pushing merchants out.

00:27:32.668 --> 00:27:34.838
Okay, I will now read the settlement agreement.

00:27:35.768 --> 00:27:38.938
Article One. The merchants of the Gangchun Cooperative...

00:27:39.008 --> 00:27:40.908
will fully cooperate with reporting by TVC's "On-Site Pursuit"...

00:27:41.148 --> 00:27:44.818
for their episode on the Gangchun HI Resort corruption.

00:27:45.478 --> 00:27:48.618
Article two. TVC Broadcasting Station and Kim Young Ho...

00:27:48.718 --> 00:27:52.388
will broadcast an apology for the "Maggots in Salted Seafood" episode.

00:27:55.858 --> 00:27:58.458
(Court)

00:28:08.268 --> 00:28:09.268
Come in.

00:28:11.378 --> 00:28:14.008
- Do you have a trial? - Yes, in ten minutes.

00:28:14.808 --> 00:28:16.878
- Did you get the settlement? - Have you seen the news?

00:28:17.778 --> 00:28:22.648
The mayor of Gangchun City is out. And the HI Group is being raided.

00:28:23.458 --> 00:28:25.658
I pulled off something big, didn't I?

00:28:26.428 --> 00:28:28.028
I even got some airtime.

00:28:28.988 --> 00:28:32.558
Oh, by the way, The Gangchun folks are a handful.

00:28:32.658 --> 00:28:34.728
- They filed another lawsuit? - Another one?

00:28:34.728 --> 00:28:36.668
You haven't heard? This time...

00:28:36.868 --> 00:28:39.608
it is against the city hall and the HI Group...

00:28:39.708 --> 00:28:41.608
for one million dollars in damages each.

00:28:42.268 --> 00:28:45.108
Wow, they keep upping the ante.

00:28:46.448 --> 00:28:47.448
Hand it over.

00:28:49.308 --> 00:28:50.318
What, for nothing?

00:28:50.578 --> 00:28:52.718
Remember that noise complaint case involving everyone...

00:28:52.718 --> 00:28:53.948
on fifteen from 1 to 15?

00:28:54.018 --> 00:28:55.918
That woman who sued everyone in the building.

00:28:56.088 --> 00:28:59.218
I went through a lot for you on that one,

00:28:59.288 --> 00:29:01.288
and you still haven't paid me what you promised.

00:29:07.928 --> 00:29:09.228
(Deposit: 500 Dollars From: Kim Sang Geun)

00:29:09.898 --> 00:29:12.038
- Happy now? - With just 500 dollars?

00:29:13.238 --> 00:29:15.308
For this job, my medical bills and gas money,

00:29:15.508 --> 00:29:18.138
and the cost to junk my car,

00:29:18.238 --> 00:29:19.508
I've attached all the receipts.

00:29:19.578 --> 00:29:21.948
So you need to reimburse me for those, too.

00:29:24.018 --> 00:29:27.448
I was going to bill for his food, but I was nice and took it off.

00:29:28.988 --> 00:29:30.318
(Seoul Lawsuit: HI Group Corporate Crimes)

00:29:36.228 --> 00:29:37.228
So this is it.

00:29:37.498 --> 00:29:39.428
The reason you gave me this job.

00:29:40.028 --> 00:29:41.928
It was all because of the HI Group.

00:29:43.438 --> 00:29:47.838
I swear on law books, it was for the salted seafood merchants.

00:29:48.008 --> 00:29:50.708
You wanted to sway public opinion before the big trial.

00:29:51.008 --> 00:29:54.508
You knew I'd make them apologise.

00:29:54.578 --> 00:29:58.778
I knew there was more...

00:29:58.918 --> 00:30:00.418
You are one scary man.

00:30:01.418 --> 00:30:02.748
I'm telling you, that's not it.

00:30:03.018 --> 00:30:05.318
I'm telling you, I was truly worried about the merchants.

00:30:05.388 --> 00:30:07.928
Whatever. I'm going back to frying chicken.

00:30:08.858 --> 00:30:10.158
Pillip and I...

00:30:10.658 --> 00:30:15.068
we almost got killed by that truck. Producer Kim Young Ho was right.

00:30:15.668 --> 00:30:18.768
You have to dig for the truth until the very end.

00:30:19.538 --> 00:30:20.838
That's not what this is!

00:30:24.108 --> 00:30:25.108
Darn...

00:30:25.578 --> 00:30:27.548
Look at this. Down to the last penny.

00:30:28.648 --> 00:30:29.818
This is insane.

00:30:30.348 --> 00:30:32.018
Isn't he so photogenic?

00:30:33.318 --> 00:30:36.018
Hey! Hey, you're a star now!

00:30:36.318 --> 00:30:39.218
- I'm far from being a star, kid. - No!

00:30:39.988 --> 00:30:41.328
Look at this, look! See?

00:30:41.788 --> 00:30:44.358
"Cop Catches Hostage-Taker With Civilian's Help."

00:30:44.598 --> 00:30:46.928
It already has over two million views.

00:30:47.128 --> 00:30:51.868
A TV station wants an interview, and there's talk of a commendation.

00:30:52.168 --> 00:30:55.868
Let's be honest, you're the one that gathered the proof.

00:30:56.108 --> 00:30:58.238
The Maheonseo detectives just swooped in to take the credit.

00:30:58.438 --> 00:31:01.678
That's life. Some set the table, and others just come to eat.

00:31:02.408 --> 00:31:04.818
Still, you'll be able to return to the Detective Task Force, right?

00:31:05.648 --> 00:31:09.488
I've been waiting for 15 years. It's not like I'm an old boy.

00:31:23.968 --> 00:31:25.138
By the way, Boss.

00:31:25.668 --> 00:31:29.668
How do you think they caught him? There's no way he turned himself in.

00:31:29.778 --> 00:31:30.878
Oh Jin Ho?

00:31:31.878 --> 00:31:33.578
Is that his name? Oh Jin Ho?

00:31:35.208 --> 00:31:38.318
Yes. Apparently, he parked illegally,

00:31:38.378 --> 00:31:40.448
and someone reported him.

00:31:40.788 --> 00:31:41.788
What?

00:31:43.458 --> 00:31:45.318
I just don't get it at all.

00:31:45.688 --> 00:31:48.558
How did the orders just dry up completely in a few days?

00:31:48.988 --> 00:31:49.998
Hey.

00:31:50.498 --> 00:31:53.728
The phone was ringing nonstop last week, right, Pillip?

00:31:53.868 --> 00:31:56.098
Well, I must have taken at least a hundred calls myself.

00:31:56.128 --> 00:31:59.738
So why did they just suddenly stop cold?

00:32:00.168 --> 00:32:02.608
And I ordered a mountain of chicken too.

00:32:02.668 --> 00:32:04.308
It's because of that jinx over there.

00:32:04.638 --> 00:32:05.638
Who?

00:32:08.048 --> 00:32:09.078
Pillip.

00:32:09.508 --> 00:32:10.918
What did you do?

00:32:12.748 --> 00:32:13.948
Gosh, seriously.

00:32:14.148 --> 00:32:16.518
It's a hit! The best in our neighbourhood.

00:32:16.718 --> 00:32:18.958
You mean 100,000 people are watching him...

00:32:18.958 --> 00:32:21.058
eat chicken in a yellow suit, live?

00:32:21.588 --> 00:32:22.628
- He's here! - Why?

00:32:23.158 --> 00:32:26.628
How should I know? Many are more famous than Kkokkio.

00:32:26.698 --> 00:32:29.568
With this many views, he must be making a fortune.

00:32:29.628 --> 00:32:33.168
Look at the camera. They're my fans. Say hello. One, two, three...

00:32:33.268 --> 00:32:35.708
Some of us spend all day in front of a deep fryer,

00:32:36.208 --> 00:32:38.408
frying chicken just to barely make rent.

00:32:40.708 --> 00:32:41.908
This time, this is really...

00:32:42.178 --> 00:32:44.648
a real eye-opener for me.

00:32:45.878 --> 00:32:46.888
Hey, Pillip.

00:32:50.988 --> 00:32:52.088
Get ready.

00:32:57.828 --> 00:32:59.098
Who is it?

00:33:02.898 --> 00:33:03.998
(Chicken Center)

00:33:04.338 --> 00:33:06.808
Kkokkio, this is on the house.

00:33:07.708 --> 00:33:08.768
On the house?

00:33:09.438 --> 00:33:14.208
A small token of our appreciation for being such a loyal customer.

00:33:14.278 --> 00:33:16.878

(Donation, 50 dollars, Get lost!)

00:33:36.838 --> 00:33:39.138
Hey, you can't just tell people to get lost.

00:33:40.668 --> 00:33:42.738
- Excuse me. - Yes?

00:33:47.278 --> 00:33:49.778
You know the drill. One, two, three!

00:33:50.278 --> 00:33:53.018
Kkokkio!

00:33:53.348 --> 00:33:54.418
- See? There you go. - Oh, right.

00:33:54.418 --> 00:33:56.418
Everyone, look at the camera.

00:33:56.488 --> 00:34:00.558
One, two, three! Kkokkio!

00:34:26.948 --> 00:34:30.118
Guys. This party today is for Cho Pillip,

00:34:30.188 --> 00:34:32.558
to welcome to our family,

00:34:32.888 --> 00:34:34.658
and a birthday party for Lee Si On.

00:34:34.988 --> 00:34:37.598
Oh, and it's also a wrap party for that eventful...

00:34:37.658 --> 00:34:40.268
Gangchun Seasoned Seafood case,

00:34:40.628 --> 00:34:45.368
and also to wish for the continued success of our restaurant.

00:34:45.438 --> 00:34:47.908
So, on that note, cheers!

00:34:47.968 --> 00:34:50.278
Are you cramming a year's worth of events into one meal?

00:34:51.108 --> 00:34:53.378
Cheers.

00:34:54.048 --> 00:34:55.848
- Cheers! - Cheers.

00:34:55.878 --> 00:34:56.918
Cheers.

00:35:02.818 --> 00:35:04.958
- This is nice. - Is it your birthday?

00:35:05.418 --> 00:35:06.828
Not for another two weeks.

00:35:06.888 --> 00:35:11.298
Hold on. Anyway, with the publicity from that stream,

00:35:11.328 --> 00:35:15.028
if orders start pouring in, deliveries will get crazy busy.

00:35:15.298 --> 00:35:17.398
Pillip, do you know how to ride a motorcycle?

00:35:17.498 --> 00:35:19.738
- No, I've never ridden one before. - What?

00:35:19.738 --> 00:35:21.468
Well, I can still make the deliveries, though.

00:35:22.308 --> 00:35:23.578
Don't be ridiculous.

00:35:24.038 --> 00:35:25.308
You think just anyone can do deliveries?

00:35:25.438 --> 00:35:28.248
I mean, there's GPS on my phone. If I get lost, I can just call...

00:35:28.308 --> 00:35:29.848
There's a knack to it, you know.

00:35:31.418 --> 00:35:33.388
Stop being so full of yourself because of your good looks.

00:35:36.688 --> 00:35:39.958
So I'll learn! I guess you can teach me, Si On.

00:35:40.728 --> 00:35:43.558
You want to steal my job too? Act your age.

00:35:44.098 --> 00:35:46.158
Yes, that's a great idea, Si On.

00:35:46.398 --> 00:35:50.138
This is a perfect opportunity. Si On, you give him bike lessons,

00:35:50.198 --> 00:35:52.338
and you, Pillip, can tutor Si On.

00:35:52.568 --> 00:35:56.738
Hey, Si On. Why don't you finally take your GED?

00:35:56.808 --> 00:35:58.508
And maybe even the CSAT.

00:35:59.778 --> 00:36:02.348
Forget it. It's hard enough making ends meet.

00:36:02.578 --> 00:36:03.748
I don't have time for studying.

00:36:13.658 --> 00:36:14.888
Did you just chug that?

00:36:18.398 --> 00:36:19.498
Pillip?

00:36:22.728 --> 00:36:25.438
Pillip.

00:36:27.238 --> 00:36:31.978
- Pillip. - Looks like Si On's drunk again.

00:36:33.408 --> 00:36:35.908
- Off three beers? - Hey.

00:36:36.308 --> 00:36:38.848
Her limit is two glasses, you punk.

00:36:39.278 --> 00:36:40.318
Hey!

00:36:41.488 --> 00:36:42.488
You...

00:36:43.588 --> 00:36:44.688
Is that...

00:36:47.358 --> 00:36:48.428
an American...

00:36:49.028 --> 00:36:50.198
name?

00:36:51.758 --> 00:36:53.058
Don't call me "you."

00:36:53.468 --> 00:36:54.968
There's a limit to my patience...

00:36:55.698 --> 00:36:56.798
Pillip.

00:36:57.338 --> 00:37:01.108
You're in charge of Si On. Take her home.

00:37:01.808 --> 00:37:05.008
- Wait, me? - Ma'am, what's the bill?

00:37:05.738 --> 00:37:07.708
- Sir, where does she live? - How much?

00:37:14.018 --> 00:37:16.418
(Do not urinate.)

00:37:34.538 --> 00:37:35.808
I guess this isn't it.

00:38:28.658 --> 00:38:29.728
Is anyone home?

00:38:32.898 --> 00:38:33.968
Who is it?

00:38:34.628 --> 00:38:35.628
Si On!

00:38:36.068 --> 00:38:39.298
Your sister's sleeping. It's okay. I'm one of her coworkers.

00:38:41.338 --> 00:38:43.308
Did she have more than two beers?

00:38:44.478 --> 00:38:47.048
Grandma's sleeping, so come in quietly.

00:39:25.478 --> 00:39:26.518
She must've been exhausted.

00:39:41.568 --> 00:39:43.668
- Sir! - What is it?

00:39:43.668 --> 00:39:44.838
We have a huge problem!

00:39:51.678 --> 00:39:54.278
(Community Service Center)

00:40:07.858 --> 00:40:09.558
Number 74? Anyone?

00:40:11.828 --> 00:40:13.328
Why aren't they calling my number?

00:40:13.768 --> 00:40:15.398
Number 75.

00:40:19.138 --> 00:40:20.808
How can I help you?

00:40:22.138 --> 00:40:24.008
I'm here to see Mr. Kim.

00:40:26.408 --> 00:40:29.408
Na Yeon, could you take this to the Team Leader?

00:40:35.088 --> 00:40:36.718
What can I do for you?

00:40:36.788 --> 00:40:41.028
Right. Why did you call me, Mr. Kim?

00:40:47.328 --> 00:40:50.698
You drag me here for something, and then you make me take a number?

00:40:50.768 --> 00:40:54.338
You should have called me sooner! I've been waiting over half an hour.

00:40:54.538 --> 00:40:55.608
This is so frustrating.

00:40:57.838 --> 00:40:59.038
What's this?

00:40:59.078 --> 00:41:03.248
The complainant posting maliciously on the forum for a year.

00:41:03.678 --> 00:41:06.178
Hey, Master Shin, can you take care of this for me? Please.

00:41:06.248 --> 00:41:09.848
Hey, I'm Master Shin. I fry chicken for a living.

00:41:09.888 --> 00:41:13.888
You're a service center manager who's meant to serve the public.

00:41:13.958 --> 00:41:17.358
Local elections are coming up. The Mayor is on the District Mayor,

00:41:17.428 --> 00:41:20.968
the District Mayor's on the Director and it's all rolled downhill to me.

00:41:21.028 --> 00:41:25.638
It must be resolved by month's end. I'm losing sleep over this.

00:41:25.668 --> 00:41:26.868
Then just delete them.

00:41:27.008 --> 00:41:31.438
When we deleted a few last year, they posted 2 or 3 times more.

00:41:31.438 --> 00:41:33.948
They completely flooded the forum.

00:41:34.148 --> 00:41:36.978
Then it slowed to maybe 2 or 3 a month,

00:41:37.048 --> 00:41:40.718
but since last month, they've been posting 3 or 4 a week.

00:41:40.818 --> 00:41:42.288
And on top of all that,

00:41:42.488 --> 00:41:46.158
these days, you'll cause an uproar if you delete posts from the forum.

00:41:46.288 --> 00:41:48.688
Then resolve their complaint.

00:41:48.758 --> 00:41:52.298
If I could, I wouldn't ask you, Master Shin.

00:41:53.128 --> 00:41:57.698
With the election so close, the higher-ups fear losing support,

00:41:57.768 --> 00:41:59.838
and those of us at the bottom can't do anything.

00:42:00.098 --> 00:42:04.378
I seriously think I'm going to die. I'm going to die, I swear.

00:42:05.478 --> 00:42:06.908
Goodness.

00:42:07.208 --> 00:42:08.508
Do you even know who it is?

00:42:09.278 --> 00:42:13.788
It was posted anonymously, but I do have a suspect in mind.

00:42:14.718 --> 00:42:15.718
Yes.

00:42:24.228 --> 00:42:26.858
This video was just uploaded to the Blue House public forum.

00:42:32.538 --> 00:42:34.338
Isn't that Hwang Seong Sik, the mayor of Yongdan City?

00:42:34.408 --> 00:42:38.778
Yes. He was abducted this morning. His phone was found at the scene.

00:42:38.778 --> 00:42:39.838
What about the kidnapper?

00:42:39.908 --> 00:42:43.578
They're not in the video, and the IP address was masked.

00:42:43.648 --> 00:42:44.918
What does the kidnapper want?

00:42:44.918 --> 00:42:48.518
There are no demands. The post only had one sentence.

00:42:48.918 --> 00:42:51.758
- "You will all pay for your sins." - Have you identified the location?

00:43:04.298 --> 00:43:05.298
Thank you.

00:43:11.238 --> 00:43:13.878
Pillip, you must be loaded. Taking taxis everywhere.

00:43:13.948 --> 00:43:16.708
Boss, you told me to commute to a place with no bus service.

00:43:16.708 --> 00:43:19.318
What do you mean there's no bus? Did I crawl my way here?

00:43:19.318 --> 00:43:20.418
Well, there is one.

00:43:20.748 --> 00:43:22.888
Once in the morning, and once in the evening.

00:43:23.048 --> 00:43:24.118
Exactly twice a day.

00:43:24.188 --> 00:43:27.988
You've got a smart mouth. Always need the last word, right?

00:43:31.628 --> 00:43:33.098
So, what brings you here anyway?

00:43:33.358 --> 00:43:35.668
To resolve a complaint for a client.

00:43:37.368 --> 00:43:40.938
What's this mediation about? Did Judge Kim Sang Geun stop by?

00:43:41.138 --> 00:43:42.938
Did he happen to mention me?

00:43:51.478 --> 00:43:52.748
About Ms. Lee Si On.

00:43:53.448 --> 00:43:55.888
She lives with her grandmother and a younger sibling?

00:43:57.618 --> 00:44:00.488
- Her parents aren't around? - Are you interested in Si On?

00:44:00.858 --> 00:44:03.028
What? Oh, no.

00:44:03.428 --> 00:44:07.368
You told me to tutor her. I have to know her to prepare.

00:44:07.428 --> 00:44:10.168
Then give her a level test. Why are you digging into her life?

00:44:10.198 --> 00:44:11.698
I'm telling you, it's not like that!

00:44:12.138 --> 00:44:13.768
Why are you getting so worked up?

00:44:14.468 --> 00:44:15.508
You're being suspicious.

00:44:19.778 --> 00:44:21.008
Hello? Anyone home?

00:44:23.778 --> 00:44:24.878
Hello?

00:44:28.448 --> 00:44:29.548
Is anyone here?

00:44:40.358 --> 00:44:41.768
So, who lives here?

00:44:41.998 --> 00:44:44.768
The one who made the malicious post about the Community Service Center.

00:44:52.238 --> 00:44:54.648
Username WKQCH?

00:44:55.408 --> 00:44:57.008
On a Korean keyboard, it spells out "Weed."

00:44:57.078 --> 00:45:00.148
He keeps repeating the phrase, "You must pay for your sins."

00:45:02.048 --> 00:45:04.758
- So this is where Weed lives? - I'm not sure.

00:45:39.018 --> 00:45:40.058
Diesel?

00:45:51.798 --> 00:45:53.298
- Boss. - Yes?

00:45:53.368 --> 00:45:55.338
That picture you just took. That's ammonium nitrate, right?

00:45:57.578 --> 00:46:00.308
- I wonder what they used it for. - Isn't that fertilizer?

00:46:00.878 --> 00:46:03.048
This is the countryside, so they probably use it for farming.

00:46:03.148 --> 00:46:04.248
Okay, a question for you.

00:46:04.348 --> 00:46:07.718
The federal building in Oklahoma in 1995.

00:46:08.048 --> 00:46:12.958
2002, Bali, Indonesia. And 2011, Oslo's government quarter.

00:46:13.018 --> 00:46:16.328
What do these three have in common? Easy for a top police grad, right?

00:46:17.558 --> 00:46:19.158
They were all sites of terrorist bombings.

00:46:19.228 --> 00:46:20.828
And the other common factor?

00:46:21.968 --> 00:46:24.968
What happens when you mix ammonium nitrate with diesel fuel?

00:46:25.568 --> 00:46:29.068
An ammonium nitrate bomb. It's extremists' bomb of choice...

00:46:29.138 --> 00:46:30.308
because it's so easy to make.

00:46:31.608 --> 00:46:34.478
I've seen one firsthand in the Middle East.

00:46:35.308 --> 00:46:36.408
Were you in the military?

00:46:36.478 --> 00:46:40.648
Hey! What man in South Korea hasn't served in the military?

00:46:42.188 --> 00:46:44.358
- Don't tell me you're an exception. - I was stationed at a GP.

00:46:47.388 --> 00:46:49.688
Anyway, why the sudden talk about bombs?

00:46:50.288 --> 00:46:52.158
I don't know. Something feels off.

00:46:55.468 --> 00:46:56.598
(Pay for sins, toxic substance)

00:46:56.668 --> 00:46:58.398
(Negligence, pay for sins, illegal, pay for sins)

00:46:58.468 --> 00:47:01.208
(Tears of blood, death, negligence, corruption, illegal, murderer)

00:47:07.408 --> 00:47:09.878
(Ammonium nitrate)

00:47:34.468 --> 00:47:35.568
(Chicken Center)

00:47:47.848 --> 00:47:48.948
Hey, the drink is missing.

00:47:49.018 --> 00:47:50.648
Oh, they asked to leave it out when they ordered.

00:47:50.718 --> 00:47:54.158
- I see. I'm heading out. - All right, take care.

00:47:54.228 --> 00:47:55.428
Wait a second.

00:47:59.558 --> 00:48:00.928
Are you free this weekend?

00:48:01.668 --> 00:48:02.668
Me?

00:48:02.928 --> 00:48:07.438
The GED exam is held twice a year, and next month's is too soon,

00:48:08.338 --> 00:48:11.178
so I was thinking we could aim for the 2nd test 4 months from now.

00:48:16.878 --> 00:48:19.018
The customer will be really mad if this gets cold.

00:48:29.358 --> 00:48:30.458
So that's...

00:48:31.258 --> 00:48:32.298
not a no?

00:48:36.898 --> 00:48:38.098
Check inside first.

00:48:38.168 --> 00:48:40.668
Hey, get upstairs, quickly! Hurry up.

00:48:40.738 --> 00:48:41.938
Move!

00:48:42.708 --> 00:48:44.108
I'm...

00:48:44.578 --> 00:48:47.678
I'm Hwang Seong Sik, the mayor of Yongdan City.

00:48:49.108 --> 00:48:53.318
I have done wrong. People died because of me.

00:48:53.978 --> 00:48:55.888
I deserve to die for what I've done.

00:48:57.488 --> 00:48:58.518
Commissioner.

00:48:58.918 --> 00:49:02.158
It sounds like he's referring to the deaths in Yongdan City.

00:49:02.228 --> 00:49:05.198
And the kidnapper seems to think that Mayor Hwang's to blame.

00:49:05.328 --> 00:49:09.268
During Mayor Hwang's term, there've been 38 deaths in Yongdan,

00:49:09.328 --> 00:49:11.838
and we're contacting the families to get more details.

00:49:11.868 --> 00:49:13.998
It's likely the kidnapper is one of the victims' family members.

00:49:14.068 --> 00:49:16.908
We're searching abandoned warehouses around Yongdan City,

00:49:17.068 --> 00:49:19.808
but we have to be discreet, so it's taking some time.

00:49:20.108 --> 00:49:21.508
Commissioner, let's open a tip line.

00:49:21.548 --> 00:49:24.418
No way! The media might provoke the kidnapper.

00:49:24.448 --> 00:49:26.878
And if Mayor Hwang ends up dead, who's going to take responsibility?

00:49:35.688 --> 00:49:36.728
Hello?

00:49:39.158 --> 00:49:41.028
Is anyone here?

00:49:41.828 --> 00:49:42.828
Who is it?

00:49:42.898 --> 00:49:45.868
Oh, hello. I'm here to see Mr. Lee Sang Hyeon.

00:49:45.868 --> 00:49:48.008
Oh, Sang Hyeon didn't come home last night.

00:49:48.308 --> 00:49:50.808
- Why do you ask about my youngest? - Do you know where he went?

00:49:50.878 --> 00:49:54.278
He's between here and his gosiwon, studying for the civil service exam.

What is this about with my youngest son?

00:49:56.808 --> 00:50:00.378
Well, I just need to talk to him about something.

00:50:00.718 --> 00:50:02.718
I just can't get a hold of him.

00:50:02.788 --> 00:50:05.488
He doesn't really answer his phone when he's studying.

00:50:06.388 --> 00:50:07.858
But wait, who are you?

00:50:08.528 --> 00:50:11.298
Ma'am, does Mr. Lee happen to do any farming?

00:50:17.468 --> 00:50:19.238
Team One, go right. Team Two, with me.

00:50:19.298 --> 00:50:20.298
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

00:50:21.408 --> 00:50:22.408
Clear!

00:50:25.908 --> 00:50:26.908

- Congratulations. - Stop it. That's so embarrassing.

00:51:12.361 --> 00:51:13.361
Stop it.

00:51:13.361 --> 00:51:16.061
Come on, why not? You're finally getting reinstated.

00:51:16.431 --> 00:51:18.971
I told you so. I said this wasn't wishful thinking.

00:51:19.071 --> 00:51:20.471
All right, that's enough.

00:51:20.571 --> 00:51:24.471
- All right, back to work. - It's a classic hero's story.

A cop disgraced 15 years ago endures hardships, biding his time.

And now he returns to HQ as a hero, thanks to that very same case.

00:51:32.581 --> 00:51:35.551
- Pretty epic, right? - Ever seen such a pathetic hero?

00:51:35.551 --> 00:51:36.721

Hello.

It's ringing, but they're not picking up.

00:51:52.401 --> 00:51:56.201
This is really urgent, so please, just try one more time.

00:51:57.641 --> 00:51:58.811
Okay, I will.

00:52:00.011 --> 00:52:01.681
By the way, I'm getting reinstated.

00:52:02.411 --> 00:52:04.481
I have to think there's a reason for all this.

- The rest of you, ID the suspect. - Yes, sir!

00:52:24.031 --> 00:52:25.971
Police. We need your cooperation.

00:52:28.601 --> 00:52:30.301
Can we take a look at the CCTV footage?

00:52:32.971 --> 00:52:34.011

I think this is our guy.

Yes. Looks like it's him.

00:52:46.621 --> 00:52:49.361
After we hang up, if I don't call back within five minutes,

00:52:49.791 --> 00:52:52.661
call 112 and give them the address I'm sending you now.

00:52:53.291 --> 00:52:54.731
And Pillip, you get over there too!

00:52:54.861 --> 00:52:56.001

Oh, so you were in here.

Well, I...

00:54:21.321 --> 00:54:23.681
I just wanted to have a quick word with you.

You posted that civil complaint on the Community Service Center site.

Could you please take that down?

00:55:10.161 --> 00:55:11.301
It's because of your brother, right?

00:55:16.941 --> 00:55:19.111
Hey, you know that guy you asked me to look into?

00:55:19.471 --> 00:55:20.771
- Turns out, he's a pretty big deal. - Oh, sorry.

00:55:20.841 --> 00:55:22.141
- I'll have to call you back. - Only a few in the country...

Team 3, cover the rear! Team 1, take the front!

What?

I said, from now on, you negotiate with me.

Three beef head rice soup.
