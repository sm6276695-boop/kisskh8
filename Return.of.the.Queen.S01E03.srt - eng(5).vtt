[Return of the Queen]

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.450
[Episode 3]

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.240
Siyu?

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.080
It's you.

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.180
That day at the lounge bar—

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:17.410
Yes, that was me.

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:19.720
So?

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.079
I just

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:22.440
didn't expect

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:23.570
to run into you here.

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:26.410
I'm here to see Haimeng.

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:27.200
Oh, right.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.810
You came back together.

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:32.240
We haven't gotten

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:33.200
to know each other yet.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.460
I'm Haimeng's cousin.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:35.040
My name is Ye—

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.079
Ye Bochen.

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:37.160
You know my name?

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.920
I don't just know your name.

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.560
I know your position

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:41.480
at Mare Nubium.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.579
I know everything about the Ye family

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.400
you and Haimeng belong to—things you know,

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.000
and things you don't.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.720
You...

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.400
Don't stick your nose

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.800
where it doesn't belong.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:55.920
Don't meet people

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.120
you shouldn't.

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:58.720
Focus on holding onto

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.480
your spot at Mare Nubium.

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:02.640
Guard

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.120
your heart.

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:10.520
Otherwise,

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.320
you'll lose it someday
without even realizing it.

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:24.280
Bochen,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.800
what's wrong?

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.060
Did Ye Bochen give you a hard time?

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.170
This has nothing to do with him.

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.930
Sometimes I really want to ask—

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.440
why did you come back?

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.360
Was it to get close to the Lu family,

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:57.480
or the Ye family?

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:58.960
What secrets

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:00.960
are you hiding in your heart?

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.050
You really want to know?

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:19.399
Aren't you afraid

00:04:19.399 --> 00:04:21.200
I might turn out to be your enemy?

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.180
I already have plenty of enemies.

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.220
One more won't make a difference.

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:32.360
What did you find

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:33.520
in Lu Siyu's suite?

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:34.320
Show me.

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.360
Time was too tight this time.

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.960
I couldn't open the lock box.

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:39.080
But—

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:40.900
I did find something else.

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:48.460
[Siyu, don't forget to check in with Dad.]

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:49.590
What's strange about this?

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:49.760
[Siyu, don't forget to check in with Dad.]

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.360
This is Du Meiyun's handwriting.

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.880
This is just Du Meiyun's

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:53.880
note of instructions

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:54.680
to her youngest son.

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:55.760
What does it have to do

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:56.740
with the clues we're looking for?

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:59.170
[Siyu, don't forget to check in with Dad.]

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:07.080
[Tianyang]

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.480
The term "Tianyang"

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:09.800
doesn't sound like something

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.240
a normal business would use.

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:13.240
Unless it's a pharmaceutical company

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:14.000
or a business

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.320
in health

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:16.160
and wellness.

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.240
Du Meiyun would only use the term

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:19.760
on a document

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.000
in two cases:

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:22.520
either at the sanatorium of

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:24.040
Lu Changdong,
who's been ill away from home,

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:25.160
or at a health-related business

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:26.400
secretly owned

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:27.920
by Du Meiyun—

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:29.120
or even

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:30.240
by the Lu family.

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:32.600
Could it be...

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:34.159
They sent my mother

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:35.400
to a wellness center?

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:39.480
I've already looked into

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:41.280
all of the Lu family's businesses
on the surface.

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:42.600
There's no such company.

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:43.560
Then we need to dig deeper.

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:44.880
Pull up everything

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:45.800
on Changlu Capital—

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:46.840
all shareholders,

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:47.800
directors,

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:49.640
silent partners,

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:50.680
and affiliated businesses
under their name,

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:52.040
especially those connected

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:53.520
to the healthcare industry.

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:54.720
Check them one by one.

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:56.490
We will definitely find it.

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:57.520
And we will, without a doubt,

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:58.920
get to her before they do,

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:00.890
and rescue your mother.

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:02.000
Okay.

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:09.570
Why are you still up so late?

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:11.920
Ye Haimeng forced me into

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:13.080
such a tiny room.

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:13.800
As soon as I go in,

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:14.720
I can barely breathe.

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.160
How am I supposed to sleep?

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:17.440
It's not that bad.

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:19.520
It's still a suite, isn't it?

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:22.040
How could a guest room on the first floor

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:22.800
ever compare to

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.240
the master bedroom upstairs?

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:25.320
And your wife

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:26.650
is being pushed around,

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:28.720
but you're just standing there
doing nothing.

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:29.760
I don't know

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:30.840
what possessed me

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:33.370
to go along with my mother's wish
to marry you.

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:35.560
Don't take everything out

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:36.560
on me, will you?

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:38.920
All these years in your Lu family,

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:39.920
I've been working diligently,

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:40.760
almost like a son.

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:42.420
Like a son? That's not enough.

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:44.320
You're my husband.

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:45.520
You should be fully devoted

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:46.520
to the Lu family.

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:48.080
Especially now—

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:49.440
my father's away,

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:50.480
my brother's still immature,

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:51.640
and my mother and I
are under attack from all sides.

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:52.280
This is when you need to

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:53.480
step up.

00:06:58.159 --> 00:06:59.480
I get it now.

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:01.600
Whatever you have to say,

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:02.460
just be direct.

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:09.650
My mother said the other day

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:11.320
that she has a way

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:12.640
to transfer Ye Haimeng's uncle's

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:14.040
Mare Nubium shares

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:15.890
into the Lu family's hands.

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:18.040
But to me,

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:19.480
it doesn't sound too reliable.

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:20.440
Still, the fact that Ye Haimeng

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:22.360
dared to return to Cloud Manor

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:25.840
means she must already have a plan
in place.

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:30.720
Jiang Lin,

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:32.640
Mare Nubium is still

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:33.770
in our hands for now.

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:35.440
We can't just stand by

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:36.720
and watch Ye Haimeng

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:38.450
and that woman she brought back

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:40.200
take Mare Nubium away from us.

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:41.460
What plan do they have?

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:47.180
If we just wait for them to act,

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:48.760
we're sitting ducks.

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:50.940
What do you want to do then?

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:52.280
We must

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:56.240
strike first.

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:25.930
Go ahead.

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:27.000
Yes.

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:28.960
Siyu,

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:30.440
are you heading out?

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:30.840
Yes,

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:31.840
Bochen mentioned

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:33.600
a new sports center

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:35.039
that'd be perfect
for starting an archery club.

00:08:35.039 --> 00:08:36.520
I'm thinking of checking it out tonight.

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:37.159
Well,

00:08:37.159 --> 00:08:38.360
I can arrange for someone
to drive you there.

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:38.840
No need.

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:39.919
I can drive myself.

00:08:39.919 --> 00:08:41.250
Are all the cars at home?

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:43.559
Madam's car is out,

00:08:43.559 --> 00:08:44.480
but the rest are here.

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:45.200
Great.

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:46.360
I'll go get the car then.

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:47.000
Siyu.

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:21.660
You're the driver, right?

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:24.480
You look terrified.

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:26.000
Si... Siyu.

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:27.840
I need to use the car.

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:29.080
Is this Lin's?

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:32.120
It's Siyue's car, right?

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:32.960
Yes.

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:33.960
It's Siyue's car.

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:35.840
Give me the key.

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:39.810
I'll let my sister know.

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:40.770
Don't worry.

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:43.480
Well...

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:57.380
[We will definitely find it.]

00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:58.320
[And we will, without a doubt,]

00:09:58.320 --> 00:09:59.850
[get to her before they do,]

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:01.620
[and rescue your mother.]

00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:12.600
I have an appointment with your boss

at the Lu family.

00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:32.280
Come at me.

00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:34.240
But don't you dare touch my son.

00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:38.880
If it weren't for me today,

00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:41.320
your son would already be dead—

00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:42.400
If it weren't for you today,

00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:43.000
he wouldn't have run into

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:43.960
such bad luck.

00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:44.920
So instead of going after

00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:46.040
the person who sabotaged my car

00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:47.800
and tried to hurt others,

00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:48.960
you're blaming me

00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:50.280
for saving your son.

00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:52.720
Am I right?

00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:55.640
Why are you looking at me like that?

00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:57.170
I don't care who caused this

00:21:57.680 --> 00:21:59.160
or who's targeting you.

00:21:59.160 --> 00:21:59.920
Anyway,

00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:02.240
your survival

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:04.160
is your own concern.

00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:05.080
Siyu

00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:07.140
only suffered minor injuries today,

00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:08.880
so I'll let you off this time.

00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:10.800
But remember,

00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:13.400
stay away from Siyu from now on.

00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:15.800
If I ever find you

00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:17.400
near him again,

00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:20.400
causing him even the slightest harm...

00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:26.920
I will never let you get away with it.

00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:36.480
Siyue.

00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:39.400
Tell Jiang Lin to send someone

00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:41.060
to guard your brother's room.

00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:42.840
No one may enter

00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:44.480
without our permission,

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.460
particularly those specific individuals.

00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:51.200
Yes, Mom.

00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:53.010
I'll arrange it right away.

00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:46.000
Madam instructed us

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:46.920
to take her potted plants

00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:48.080
out into the sun.

00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:53.320
Siyu.

00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:54.520
Why are you out of bed?

00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:56.560
I've been sleeping
all the time in the hospital.

00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:57.800
Then I slept for several more days
after coming home.

00:23:57.800 --> 00:23:58.920
I've slept so much that my head hurts.

00:23:58.920 --> 00:23:59.920
But the doctor said

00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:00.720
that during this accident,

00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:01.800
you hit your head.

00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:03.800
You should be resting in bed.

00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:07.800
Why is the house so quiet?

00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:08.680
Is nobody home?

00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:10.480
Madam left early this morning.

00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:12.280
She said
she had something important to do.

00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:13.600
Siyue is meeting friends.

00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:15.060
Mr. Jiang Lin went to work.

00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:17.880
And the others?

00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:19.320
The others?

00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:22.840
Do you mean

00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:24.280
Ms. Ye upstairs?

00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:26.400
No,

00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:27.560
I was just asking.

00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:29.440
Siyu.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:31.240
Don't mind me rambling.

00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:32.280
Ms. Ye...

00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:43.640
I thought you weren't here.

00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:44.480
I've been back

00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:45.400
from the hospital for several days now,

00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:46.920
but I haven't seen you at all.

00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:48.120
I need to talk to you.

00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:51.610
But I have nothing to say to you.

00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:54.040
Does it have to be like this?

00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:55.700
Why are you being so cold to me?

00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:57.640
Did I do something wrong?

00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:00.160
Or do you just dislike me?

00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:00.640
Yes,

00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:02.640
I dislike you.

00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:07.040
Why?

00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:08.600
Dislike is dislike—

00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:09.800
there doesn't have to be a reason.

00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:10.730
Get out of my way.

00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:13.320
If you dislike me,

00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:14.480
then why did you save me?

00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:16.160
Because you were in my car.

00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:18.280
I didn't want anyone

00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:19.800
to have an accident in my car.

00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:20.720
If it were a stranger,

00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:22.180
I would have done the same.

00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:23.560
Is this explanation

00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:24.820
satisfactory enough?

00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:27.170
You didn't want to watch me die,

00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:27.800
did you?

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:30.960
Is it because

00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:34.810
my brother died in front of you?

00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:41.840
Don't try to analyze me,

00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:44.300
and don't pretend you understand me.

00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:45.000
That night,

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:46.280
it was just on a whim

00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:48.320
that I staged a little accident.

00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:49.400
It had nothing to do

00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:51.360
with who you are.

00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:52.280
You'd better

00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:53.280
erase it

00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:54.160
from your mind.

00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:55.610
Keep your distance.

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:57.330
Don't provoke me again.

00:25:58.600 --> 00:25:59.860
Don't come any closer.

00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:03.560
What if I don't want to?

00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:05.480
I don't want to stay away from you.

00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:06.810
I want to be close to you.

00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:08.880
Can you please stop pushing me away?

00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:09.560
Lu Siyu.

00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:10.440
I can't pretend

00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:10.960
nothing happened

00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:12.360
that day.

00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:13.840
Even though

00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:15.000
I don't know what happened

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:16.440
between you and my family,

00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:17.440
or what you went through

00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:18.600
with my brother,

00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:20.480
I remember clearly—

00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:22.320
in my most dangerous moment,

00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:23.440
you saved me.

00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:24.560
I don't think I should stay away

00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:26.420
from the person who saved my life.

00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:27.320
All these days,

00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:28.780
I've been waiting for you.

00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:29.720
I just wanted

00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:30.980
to tell you something.

00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:32.520
Thank you,

00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:34.120
Meng.

00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:03.080
Changdong,

00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:04.600
we're home.

00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:25.580
Changdong.

00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:26.400
Here.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:41.800
Kid,

00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:44.380
