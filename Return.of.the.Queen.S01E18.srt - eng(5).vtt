[Return of the Queen]

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.180
[Episode 18]

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:55.150
I already had high expectations

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:56.039
for him.

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.200
Who would've thought he'd be this great?

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.789
Exactly!

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.310
You're really incredible

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.790
and so handsome!

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.430
Can we take a photo together?

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:06.560
Sure.

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:09.800
Thank you.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.400
Could you sign an autograph for me?

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.080
Just sign it on my phone case, please.

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.590
Sure.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:15.360
Done.

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:16.030
Thank you.

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.560
Could you...

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:17.150
You're welcome.

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:18.360
Sign on my hand?

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:19.360
Please sign one for me.

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.630
Help me.

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:24.430
Hello.

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:25.800
My surname is Song.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:26.800
I'm Song Yang.

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:27.870
Lu Siyu and I

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.280
met at a club competition

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.140
abroad before.

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:31.470
We're kind of

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:32.730
competition friends.

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.750
Hello.

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:35.470
I noticed you were here

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:36.560
throughout the entire competition today.

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:37.310
Did you come

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.079
specifically to accompany Lu Siyu?

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:40.000
Are you two also

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:41.079
good friends?

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.960
Friends?

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:43.560
No.

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:45.310
Then are you

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:46.680
his relative?

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.810
His cousin?

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:49.560
No, not that either.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:50.820
Then are you his agent?

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.210
Training partner?

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:53.400
Coach?

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.170
What exactly are you trying to say?

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.120
I'm saying if you two

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.470
don't have any relationship,

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:01.310
could we exchange

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:02.570
contact information?

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:07.310
No.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.960
You...

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:12.400
This

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.240
is my boyfriend.

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.000
Is that so hard to believe?

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.150
What misconception made you think

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:20.910
she's my coach,

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:21.710
agent,

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:22.560
or relative?

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.910
Let me tell you.

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:24.710
She is my

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:25.590
official,

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:26.520
genuine,

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.050
and properly acknowledged

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.960
girlfriend.

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.150
This is so unfair!

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:39.680
It's fine that I lost to you
in the competition.

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.120
But I finally find someone...

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.630
Sorry.

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:43.190
And I lost to you again.

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:44.430
Lu Siyu, you're unbelievable!

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.840
I...

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:46.560
I hate you.

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.110
Why did you talk to him like that?

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:54.960
He was trying to steal you

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:56.090
right in front of me.

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:58.030
You

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:59.430
are mine.

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:05.190
Don't go.

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:06.960
Why are you ignoring me?

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.030
You've said everything.

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:10.120
What else can I say?

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.630
Of course you should respond

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:11.870
to my love confession.

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:13.360
No matter what happens,

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:14.750
you are my whole life.

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:15.520
What about you?

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:16.070
What do you think?

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:17.060
Is your whole life

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.839
also going to be...

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:20.200
[Main Venue]

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:26.070
Haimeng.

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:27.760
Stop pouring it into...

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:30.870
Alright, I'm not drinking more.

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:39.070
[Main Venue]

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:45.720
Could you please stop

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:46.630
staring at me?

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:48.250
You're beautiful.

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:51.490
Be careful!

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:56.000
I didn't fall at all.

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:59.390
Your alcohol tolerance is worse

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:00.790
a kindergarten toddler.

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:02.000
When I'm not around,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.600
you're not allowed to drink.

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:05.800
A toddler?

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.720
I'm clearly a "senior toddler"!

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.070
Are you implying

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:12.600
I'm a kid again?

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.040
Didn't I tell you

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:15.480
not to see me as a kid?

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:16.870
I'm your boyfriend!

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:18.600
I'm

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:21.920
your tall, handsome,

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:23.830
well-behaved, obedient,

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.760
and championship-winning boyfriend.

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:35.190
Am I not handsome?

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:44.000
Not really.

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:53.870
Tell me the truth.

00:05:54.159 --> 00:05:55.310
Did your heart

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:56.830
skip a beat?

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:02.030
Can you stop fooling around?

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:03.070
Either you come back to the hotel

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:04.480
with me to get some rest,

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:05.270
or

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:06.680
you can stay here
with your cardboard cutout

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:08.280
and live happily ever after.

00:06:42.159 --> 00:06:42.950
Haimeng.

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:45.600
I like you.

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:47.800
I want to be with you

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:49.240
every single moment.

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:51.510
I don't want to be away

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:54.360
from you for even a second.

00:06:56.159 --> 00:06:57.240
I hate myself

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:00.310
for being abroad all this time

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:01.630
and not showing up

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:03.070
by your side earlier.

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:05.800
My heart aches for

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.460
all the pain you've suffered.

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:10.270
I hate myself

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:12.120
for not being able to share

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:13.630
the pain with you.

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:20.500
None of those has anything to do with you.

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:22.680
Forget those things

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:24.000
from the past,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:24.630
okay?

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:28.650
Besides, none of these

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:29.600
is your fault.

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:32.320
I've already forgotten all about them.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.240
You should too.

00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:41.480
No matter what happens

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:42.720
in the future,

00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:44.000
even if there are enormous

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.659
misunderstandings or hurts,

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:47.190
promise me

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:52.510
that we will always firmly

00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:53.710
believe in each other

00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:56.850
and never hurt each other.

00:07:57.070 --> 00:07:58.400
No matter what happens,

00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:01.120
we won't break up.

00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:25.360
I promise you.

00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:29.160
No matter what happens,

00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:30.870
we

00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:34.400
will never break up.

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:44.080
I want to kiss you now.

00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:48.600

Good morning.

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:21.440
Did you sleep well?

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:25.360
I had a sweet dream yesterday.

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:27.870
It was so sweet

00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:29.440
that I don't want to wake up now.

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:30.770
Then sleep a bit longer.

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:32.360
Maybe

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:34.290
you'll dream about your cute self.

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:36.180
I'm not sleeping anymore.

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:38.320
I'm getting up.

00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:45.440
What's this?

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:48.620
Why are you over there?

00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:50.270
If I'm not here,

00:10:50.510 --> 00:10:51.550
where should I be?

00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:54.000
Last night, didn't

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:54.360
we...

00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:56.030
Last night

00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:57.790
was so amazing.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:09.750
What did you say?

00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:10.910
I was kissing this last night?

00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:12.790
I even brought
my own cardboard cutout home?

00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:13.870
That's not all.

00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:14.550
Yesterday,

00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:16.120
you wanted to shower with it

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:16.750
and show me

00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:17.840
both of your abs.

00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:20.120
But don't worry.

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:21.150
I stopped you.

00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:22.720
I gave you hangover pills

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:23.670
and you went right to sleep.

00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:24.440
With it by your side,

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:25.550
you slept quite well.

But don't drink anymore in the future.

I'm afraid when you get excited,

you might bring back
all the cardboard cutouts

you're targeting our Ye family

00:20:51.070 --> 00:20:52.790

00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:00.120

if you want me to be your partner,

00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:25.880
at least you need to tell me

I want to help you.

00:21:52.030 --> 00:21:53.310
Save it.

00:21:53.790 --> 00:21:55.830
You don't even dare to stand up
to your foster father.

00:21:55.830 --> 00:21:57.560
How could you possibly help me?

00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:06.520
I don't care what you think of me.

00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:09.110
Today I need you to tell me the truth.

00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:14.110
Go away!

Is your mother

00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:39.270
surnamed Zhang?

00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:44.400
What did you say?

00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:46.070
Is your mother

Zhang Yujie,

the CFO at Mare Nubium

00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:52.070
10 years ago?

00:24:09.030 --> 00:24:10.230
Have you ordered yet?

00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:11.350
I heard this restaurant's

00:24:11.350 --> 00:24:13.590
signature dishes are really delicious.

00:24:13.590 --> 00:24:15.050
It's my treat. I'll order.

00:24:15.350 --> 00:24:16.480
Look at the time.

00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:19.860
You just now remembered to treat me
to a meal?

00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:22.830
Fine.

00:24:24.310 --> 00:24:26.170
Next time when you're not around,

00:24:26.510 --> 00:24:27.680
I won't drink again.

00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:29.000
If you ever

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:30.200
see me drinking again,

00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:31.730
you have to keep an eye on me.

00:24:32.790 --> 00:24:33.960
I really don't want to sleep

00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:35.760
with my cardboard cutout again.

00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:39.350
How about

00:24:40.750 --> 00:24:42.610
I don't go back to my room tonight?

00:24:48.030 --> 00:24:49.070
Are you serious?

00:24:57.920 --> 00:24:58.680
Let's eat.

00:25:00.510 --> 00:25:01.400
You saved this for me?

00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:01.960
Yes.

00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:13.130
It's delicious.

00:25:18.750 --> 00:25:19.550
But Siyu,

00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:22.200
the competition is over

00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:23.400
and you've got the medal.

00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:24.070
Let's head back

00:25:24.070 --> 00:25:25.510
to Haijiang first thing tomorrow.

00:25:25.510 --> 00:25:26.720
I still have

00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:27.550
a pile of things to deal with

00:25:27.550 --> 00:25:28.410
at Mare Nubium.

00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:30.550
Okay.

00:25:31.030 --> 00:25:31.550
The archery club

00:25:31.550 --> 00:25:32.510
just called me too.

00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:34.000
They said they found a new location
for the club

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:35.510
and wanted me to go back to check it out.

00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:36.160
Then let's

00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:37.400
pack our luggage this afternoon

00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:39.030
and head back early tomorrow morning.

00:25:39.030 --> 00:25:39.550
Okay.

00:25:53.110 --> 00:25:53.720
Haimeng.

00:25:56.270 --> 00:25:57.110
Even though

00:25:57.640 --> 00:25:59.790
you're here with me for the competition
this time,

00:25:59.790 --> 00:26:01.240
being away from Haijiang

00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:03.900
and from the Ye and Lu families

00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:05.270
gives me a sense

00:26:06.310 --> 00:26:07.310
of peace

00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:08.540
and happiness.

00:26:11.110 --> 00:26:12.590
So after we go back,

00:26:14.030 --> 00:26:15.560
let's keep things this way,

00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:16.590
okay?

00:26:19.110 --> 00:26:20.000
Of course.

00:26:21.270 --> 00:26:22.730
As long as we're together,

00:26:23.510 --> 00:26:24.880
even when we return to Haijiang,

00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:25.720
we don't need to care about

00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:27.380
others' opinions and stares.

00:26:28.110 --> 00:26:29.510
As long as you're with me,

00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:31.280
we can always be this happy.

00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:56.880
Let's go back to our rooms

00:26:56.880 --> 00:26:58.080
and pack our luggage.

00:26:58.640 --> 00:26:59.110
Okay.

00:26:59.110 --> 00:27:00.550
I'll call you later.

00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:01.400
Okay.

00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:04.790
What?

00:27:12.110 --> 00:27:13.840
You're just leaving like that?

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:14.750
You're really leaving?
