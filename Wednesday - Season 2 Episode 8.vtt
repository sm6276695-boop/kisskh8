[grandiose, dramatic music playing]

00:00:16.558 --> 00:00:18.934
[Wednesday] William Faulkner said,
"The past is never dead."

00:00:18.935 --> 00:00:20.019
[thunder rumbling]

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:21.813
"It's not even the past."

00:00:22.731 --> 00:00:25.025
In fact, it's all still happening.

00:00:26.317 --> 00:00:28.778
If Isaac's goal is to save his sister,

00:00:30.613 --> 00:00:32.281
why kidnap Pugsley?

00:00:32.282 --> 00:00:33.991
[man] All right. Spread out, guys.

00:00:33.992 --> 00:00:35.826
- You, that way.
- [woman] Pugsley!

00:00:35.827 --> 00:00:37.870
[Wednesday] What does
a brain-eating genius need

00:00:37.871 --> 00:00:39.956
with my half-wit brother?

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:44.251
No sign of your son.

00:00:44.252 --> 00:00:47.087
- [Morticia exhales sharply]
- Any idea why someone would kidnap him?

00:00:47.088 --> 00:00:48.881
It's a total mystery, Sheriff.

00:00:48.882 --> 00:00:51.842
Can you think of anyone
who has a grudge against your family?

00:00:51.843 --> 00:00:53.552
Could this be some kind of revenge?

00:00:53.553 --> 00:00:56.139
Are you blaming us
for our son's kidnapping?

00:00:57.015 --> 00:00:59.016
The search parties
will run through the night.

00:00:59.017 --> 00:01:02.144
Parents who were at the gala
have already left with their kids.

00:01:02.145 --> 00:01:03.687
All other students will be packed up

00:01:03.688 --> 00:01:06.107
and on their way home
by tomorrow afternoon.

00:01:07.233 --> 00:01:09.819
I'm sorry. We're doing everything we can.

00:01:10.862 --> 00:01:14.031
[Morticia] I sent your father and Lurch
out to join the search parties.

00:01:14.032 --> 00:01:15.407
They won't find Pugsley.

00:01:15.408 --> 00:01:16.700
Isaac's too smart.

00:01:16.701 --> 00:01:20.704
{\an8}You need to work together, and to pool
your psychic abilities to locate him.

00:01:20.705 --> 00:01:22.873
My mother is a Dove
who's blind to malevolence,

00:01:22.874 --> 00:01:26.544
and my psychic ability is currently
on an unauthorized leave of absence.

00:01:27.712 --> 00:01:31.423
That's why you must turn
to the other Raven in your family.

00:01:31.424 --> 00:01:32.466
My mother?

00:01:32.467 --> 00:01:35.344
These are desperate times.

00:01:35.345 --> 00:01:37.889
[wry, impish music playing]

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:47.815
Mama, I appreciate you
coming back on such short notice.

00:01:47.816 --> 00:01:50.734
Why would anyone
bother kidnapping Pugsley?

00:01:50.735 --> 00:01:52.945
Not to cast aspersions,

00:01:52.946 --> 00:01:55.614
but I know higher value corpses
than that boy.

00:01:55.615 --> 00:01:57.951
His kidnapper
isn't looking for ransom money.

00:01:58.451 --> 00:02:01.913
He's being used as a pawn
to keep us away, or a ploy to draw us in.

00:02:03.414 --> 00:02:06.626
So many delightful memories of this room.

00:02:07.335 --> 00:02:10.212
I can still hear
the terrified shrieks of my classmates

00:02:10.213 --> 00:02:12.881
during Rotwood's
Advanced Possession Class.

00:02:12.882 --> 00:02:14.508
[Hester chuckles]

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:16.052
Scaredy-cats.

00:02:18.471 --> 00:02:19.513
[Morticia exhales]

00:02:19.514 --> 00:02:21.599
[eerie music playing]

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.396
This does require
actual physical connection.

00:02:33.778 --> 00:02:37.281
Now we must clear our minds
of all past grievances.

00:02:37.282 --> 00:02:40.534
My past grievances are like fine wine.
They get better with age.

00:02:40.535 --> 00:02:41.619
Likewise.

00:02:45.456 --> 00:02:47.833
Doves and Ravens together ignite

00:02:47.834 --> 00:02:51.462
With wings of darkness and piercing eyes

00:02:52.005 --> 00:02:54.923
Guide us to truth through night and morn

00:02:54.924 --> 00:02:57.968
To this let our powers be sworn

00:02:57.969 --> 00:03:00.137
I didn't drive all this way
to hold hands in the dark.

00:03:00.138 --> 00:03:02.264
How long do we have to keep this up?

00:03:02.265 --> 00:03:05.310
Mama! For once just be quiet.
We're trying to find Pugsley.

00:03:07.103 --> 00:03:08.103
I feel something.

00:03:08.104 --> 00:03:10.606
- I feel it too.
- Do you sense it, Wednesday?

00:03:10.607 --> 00:03:13.484
[ominous music building]

00:03:16.321 --> 00:03:18.323
[scraping in distance]

00:03:20.992 --> 00:03:22.118
Hurry, Gomez!

00:03:24.412 --> 00:03:26.623
No one will ever know we were here.

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:34.631
[jauntily macabre intro music playing]

00:04:35.483 --> 00:04:36.484
[music trails off]

00:04:37.402 --> 00:04:38.569
[gasps]

00:04:39.445 --> 00:04:41.822
I saw you and Father
burying Isaac under the Skull Tree

00:04:41.823 --> 00:04:43.825
back when you were students.

00:04:45.702 --> 00:04:48.830
If there was ever a time to unburden
yourself of the truth, now is it.

00:04:54.168 --> 00:04:55.794
You've wasted enough of my time.

00:04:55.795 --> 00:04:57.171
The night of Isaac's accident,

00:04:58.089 --> 00:04:59.590
your father and I

00:05:00.258 --> 00:05:02.051
were at his laboratory

00:05:03.261 --> 00:05:04.928
in Iago Tower.

00:05:04.929 --> 00:05:07.597
[gloomy, dramatic music playing]

00:05:07.598 --> 00:05:12.269
Isaac was certain his machine
would permanently cure Francoise.

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:15.481
That she would never again
live in fear of turning into a Hyde.

00:05:16.607 --> 00:05:21.279
But the machine required
a great amount of energy to power it.

00:05:21.904 --> 00:05:23.405
And for that,

00:05:23.406 --> 00:05:25.950
Isaac turned to his best friend.

00:05:26.534 --> 00:05:27.368
Father.

00:05:31.497 --> 00:05:34.000
What could Gomez
have possibly contributed?

00:05:34.876 --> 00:05:39.213
[Morticia] Back then,
Gomez was just as electrifying as Pugsley.

00:05:40.256 --> 00:05:43.884
And Gomez was more than happy
to help his friend.

00:05:43.885 --> 00:05:46.304
But Isaac tricked him.

00:05:48.097 --> 00:05:50.058
He needed more than a spark.

00:05:53.936 --> 00:05:55.312
Unbeknownst to Francoise,

00:05:55.313 --> 00:05:59.400
Isaac was willing to sacrifice
your father's life to save hers.

00:05:59.901 --> 00:06:02.402
He even dug your father's grave

00:06:02.403 --> 00:06:04.780
under the Skull Tree in preparation.

00:06:04.781 --> 00:06:06.783
[dramatic music intensifies]

00:06:08.618 --> 00:06:09.577
[screaming]

00:06:16.584 --> 00:06:18.251
[Morticia] By the time I arrived,

00:06:18.252 --> 00:06:21.214
my darling Gomez was close to death.

00:06:22.006 --> 00:06:26.594
My sabotage
sent the machine into a frenzy.

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:38.522
Francoise, she survived the explosion,

00:06:38.523 --> 00:06:39.607
but Isaac didn't.

00:06:40.316 --> 00:06:42.234
And as for your father,

00:06:42.235 --> 00:06:46.614
the experience permanently robbed him
of his Outcast ability.

00:06:48.449 --> 00:06:49.450
Hmm.

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:51.660
Why cover it up?

00:06:51.661 --> 00:06:53.829
Because Augustus Stonehurst threatened us.

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:55.997
We knew he built Isaac the lab in secret.

00:06:55.998 --> 00:06:58.875
If we breathed a word,
he would've turned us in for murder.

00:06:58.876 --> 00:07:00.169
Hurry, Gomez.

00:07:01.587 --> 00:07:03.423
No one will ever know we were here.

00:07:04.257 --> 00:07:07.343
So you buried Isaac
in the same grave he intended for Father?

00:07:11.848 --> 00:07:12.932
Yes.

00:07:13.558 --> 00:07:15.100
Isaac must be trying again.

00:07:15.101 --> 00:07:17.394
This time using
Pugsley as the power source.

00:07:17.395 --> 00:07:20.189
That Addams headstone,
the one I saw in my premonition,

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:21.898
must have Pugsley's name on it.

00:07:21.899 --> 00:07:23.317
[sighs]

00:07:24.402 --> 00:07:29.114
I think it's best that you and Thing
go with Grandmama until Pugsley is found.

00:07:29.115 --> 00:07:31.992
For once, your mother and I
are in agreement.

00:07:31.993 --> 00:07:34.661
[Morticia] These are our sins, Wednesday.

00:07:34.662 --> 00:07:36.038
We will face them.

00:07:37.707 --> 00:07:39.416
I won't put you in danger again.

00:07:39.417 --> 00:07:40.501
Too late.

00:07:59.604 --> 00:08:00.605
[Ajax] I'm sorry.

00:08:01.814 --> 00:08:03.524
You deserve better than that.

00:08:06.277 --> 00:08:08.487
[Enid] I didn't realize
we were back on speaking terms.

00:08:08.488 --> 00:08:10.072
It took me a minute.

00:08:11.115 --> 00:08:12.200
But I'm ready to be friends.

00:08:14.535 --> 00:08:16.120
If that's cool with you.

00:08:18.498 --> 00:08:19.999
I'd like that very much.

00:08:21.959 --> 00:08:23.543
Why the change of heart?

00:08:23.544 --> 00:08:25.879
[sweet, gentle music playing]

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:28.299
I realized that
our breakup wasn't about me.

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:31.469
You know, it's nobody's fault
that your feelings changed.

00:08:32.053 --> 00:08:36.057
So I can either be angry about it,
or I can just accept it and move on.

00:08:37.975 --> 00:08:39.392
Actually, Bianca told me that.

00:08:39.393 --> 00:08:40.477
[both chuckle]

00:08:40.478 --> 00:08:42.313
She can be very persuasive.

00:08:58.829 --> 00:08:59.788
[exhales]

00:08:59.789 --> 00:09:00.997
[gasps]

00:09:00.998 --> 00:09:04.626
Please tell me that you're done
with lying wolves and beta-gorgons.

00:09:04.627 --> 00:09:06.753
I put together
a list of potential boyfriends.

00:09:06.754 --> 00:09:10.298
I already cross-referenced them
based on compatible social media profiles.

00:09:10.299 --> 00:09:12.008
Once you've narrowed it down,

00:09:12.009 --> 00:09:14.678
I can pay each one an invisible visit.

00:09:14.679 --> 00:09:17.013
See what they've left out of their bios.

00:09:17.014 --> 00:09:18.181
Hmm.

00:09:18.182 --> 00:09:19.976
I appreciate the assist,

00:09:20.476 --> 00:09:24.104
but I think I'm gonna rip a page
out of the Wednesday Addams playbook

00:09:24.105 --> 00:09:25.648
and take a break from romance.

00:09:29.902 --> 00:09:31.696
It's not very fun

00:09:32.321 --> 00:09:34.824
to be tied up and treated like a pet...

00:09:36.284 --> 00:09:37.285
is it?

00:09:37.785 --> 00:09:39.494
"Mystery meat sandwich!"

00:09:39.495 --> 00:09:41.122
"Your favorite."

00:09:43.124 --> 00:09:44.165
Conserve your energy.

00:09:44.166 --> 00:09:45.418
You're gonna need it.

00:09:48.546 --> 00:09:50.965
I wish I was at least
in one of these pictures.

00:09:53.718 --> 00:09:57.263
I never understood
your desire for a Normie life.

00:09:59.098 --> 00:10:03.269
But... knowing what Stonehurst
did to you in that lab...

00:10:06.272 --> 00:10:08.941
Neither of us got
the end that we deserved.

00:10:10.818 --> 00:10:12.403
That changes tonight.

00:10:16.782 --> 00:10:17.824
Promise me,

00:10:17.825 --> 00:10:19.743
no matter what happens,

00:10:19.744 --> 00:10:20.911
you'll do it.

00:10:21.537 --> 00:10:22.913
What we discussed.

00:10:25.082 --> 00:10:26.375
I need your word.

00:10:32.173 --> 00:10:35.675
I made Hyde tracks about 20 miles north
and dropped Pugsley's costume,

00:10:35.676 --> 00:10:37.928
then made an anonymous tip like you said.

00:10:38.429 --> 00:10:40.347
Good, huh?

00:10:40.348 --> 00:10:42.891
That'll keep the cops off our trail.

00:10:42.892 --> 00:10:47.854
Now, it's time to position
your old flame onto the board.

00:10:47.855 --> 00:10:49.773
Wednesday will know she's being played.

00:10:49.774 --> 00:10:53.568
Yeah, an Addams...
would never sacrifice one of their own.

00:10:53.569 --> 00:10:55.154
Not even a pawn.

00:10:56.072 --> 00:10:58.532
And that emotional weakness

00:10:59.283 --> 00:11:01.035
will be our checkmate.

00:11:02.703 --> 00:11:03.912
[Enid] Any Pugsley update?

00:11:03.913 --> 00:11:06.206
Still missing. But he's alive.

00:11:06.207 --> 00:11:08.375
Isaac is hellbent on saving his sister.

00:11:08.376 --> 00:11:11.628
I know he needs Pugsley.
Just need to figure out when and where.

00:11:11.629 --> 00:11:13.755
[Agnes] Crap. He's here.

00:11:13.756 --> 00:11:14.757
Who?

00:11:15.633 --> 00:11:16.550
[Enid] Isaac?

00:11:17.134 --> 00:11:18.802
No. My dad.

00:11:18.803 --> 00:11:21.888
He usually sends
some rando assistant to collect me.

00:11:21.889 --> 00:11:23.723
Your mom couldn't come get you?

00:11:23.724 --> 00:11:26.852
She's busy with
her new Normie husband and baby.

00:11:27.436 --> 00:11:29.979
I was the mistake
that kept her and my dad together

Bye. See you next year.

I wish I could help,

Pugsley wanted to be my friend
and I blew him off.

Maybe if I'd been nicer,
he wouldn't have felt the need

00:12:29.081 --> 00:12:30.832
to become BFFs with a zombie.

00:12:30.833 --> 00:12:32.584
I am my brother's keeper.

00:12:32.585 --> 00:12:34.794
I simply should have caged him
for his own protection.

Have to hibernate my bees early.

I'm redeploying the search

Finally, I get my office back.

Dort's crashing downfall
has validated my legacy.

You covered up Rowan's murder

Slurp was there,

Why don't you let your brother
pay for their mistakes,

You don't have the machine.

It would take months to rebuild.
