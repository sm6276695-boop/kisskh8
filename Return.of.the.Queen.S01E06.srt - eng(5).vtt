like this,

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:15.080
I usually

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.560
arrive earlier than the other person.

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:28.280
What?

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:29.720
My medicine.

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.320
Don't tell me you forgot again.

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:32.120
Of course not.

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:36.640
Although I don't care much

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:37.800

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:38.930
I would never forget

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.250
what I promised you.

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.400
I'm very reliable, sis.

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:51.760
Just leave it to me.

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.360
You don't need to be so close.

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:59.480
Last time when you had a fever
and passed out,

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:00.800
the doctor gave a lot of instructions,

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.040
but you didn't hear them.

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:02.840
The doctor prescribed

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.600
different medications for your symptoms.

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:05.520
Some are for reducing fever.

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:06.680
Some are for reducing inflammation.

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:07.960
Some are oral and some are topical.

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:08.760
I'm worried you might

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.240
take the wrong medicine or miss doses.

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.760
So

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.040
I've sorted them all

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.320
and put them in this little box.

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:14.360
When you go to work,

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:15.360
take this box with you.

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:16.880
Time and dosage are marked on it.

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:17.680
You can follow these instructions.

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:18.399
Every day...

00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:19.160
Lu Siyu.

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:23.680
Whether I take

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:25.320
these medicines

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:26.320
or not

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.280
is my own decision.

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.120
So

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.320
you really do hate me.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.120
I don't.

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.280
I don't hate you.

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:48.480
I'm just not used to

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:49.880
people getting so close.

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:51.810
For all these years,

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.490
I've been taking care of myself alone.

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:55.560
I'm used to it.

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:58.840
You don't hate me.

00:04:58.840 --> 00:04:59.880
That's great.

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:01.000
Remember

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.320
to take these medicines on time.

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:05.680
The doctor said
your old injury is infected.

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:06.560
You should take your medicine on time

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:07.890
so you can recover soon.

00:05:58.440 --> 00:05:59.240
What's wrong?

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:01.360
It's so bitter.

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:06.400
What are you laughing at?

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:07.600
I'm laughing because

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:09.960
when you argued with my mom

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:11.520
and Siyue,

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:13.260
you were so fierce,

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.000
but now, just taking the medicine

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.530
makes your face scrunch up.

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:48.200
When I was little,

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:49.400
I didn't like taking medicine either.

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:50.080
My family would

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:52.010
often give me these fruit candies.

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:53.400
Just one tiny piece

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:55.159
can take away the bitterness
in your mouth.

00:06:55.159 --> 00:06:56.560
If someday you feel

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:57.960
your medicine is bitter,

00:06:58.159 --> 00:06:58.960
your work is tough,

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:00.090
or your life is hard,

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:01.000
then just

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.440
unwrap one and eat it.

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.330
It will surely bring sweetness
to your heart.

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:15.840
Childish.

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:25.080
There weren't this many books before.

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:26.200
Did you buy them

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:27.260
after you moved in?

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:27.800
No.

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:29.480
I asked Mr. Mo

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:30.200
to help me

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:31.660
sort these out in advance.

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:33.800
These are your books?

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:36.640
Most of these books

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:39.730
were actually bought for me by my brother.

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:48.560
Actually,

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:50.490
I started learning archery

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:53.260
because of my brother's encouragement too.

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:55.320
Since there are

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:57.120
very few books on archery theory here,

00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:58.880
every time my brother goes
on a business trip abroad,

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:00.240
he brings back some theory books

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:00.640
for me.

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:02.400
German.

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:03.560
English.

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:05.000
Latin.

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:08.800
All these books

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:11.360
are original foreign editions.

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:13.520
Can you understand them?

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:14.880
I can manage

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:16.000
German and English.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:16.730
For Italian,

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:18.520
I rely on the translator too.

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:21.280
But Latin...

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:26.760
I don't know why

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:27.840
my brother bought

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:29.500
these Latin originals for me.

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:30.960
In this day and age,

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:32.559
who can still understand Latin?

00:08:32.559 --> 00:08:33.159
I can.

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:35.440
You know Latin?

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:36.720
Just a little bit.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:37.840
And

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:39.299
it was Sinan who taught me.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.600
That's still better than me.

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:43.400
Do you have time these days

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:44.360
to help me

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:46.730
translate the tables of contents?

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:48.680
Just use these short

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:49.560
morning hours.

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:50.640
You only need to translate the contents

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:51.700
of one or two books.

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:54.400
There are also my brother's notes in them.

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:55.400

The inside source at Mare Nubium
just reported

that Ye Haimeng
has brought people back again.

will let her control all of Mare Nubium,

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:11.640
she's too naive.

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:14.120
We've been building our network
at Mare Nubium for three years.

00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:16.000
Every level below is filled
with our people.

Even at the board level,

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:17.760
could she have

00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:18.890
more allies than us?

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:21.280
Ye Haimeng hasn't been back for years,

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:22.040
so of course we have

00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:23.320
more people on the board.

00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:24.360

00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:25.360

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:26.480

have been managing Mare Nubium
for three years.

The moment Ye Haimeng returned,

00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:49.120
she just swiftly

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:49.800
stripped away

Jiang Lin may have been
with our family for years,

but he has always been

00:13:58.360 --> 00:13:59.760
working diligently for our Lu family.

00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:01.440
Ye Haimeng outplayed him.

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:02.960
It's not that he couldn't fight back.

00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:04.480
It's just in that situation,

even you and Mr. Ye

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:06.680
couldn't put up a fight.

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:07.520
How could we blame him

00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:08.040
for everything?

Not to mention

00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:12.400
you only care about Siyu.

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:13.600
Siyu could study abroad

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:14.880
without any worries,

00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:16.400
simply focusing on his archery.

00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:17.360
He never helps the family

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:17.840
with anything.

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:19.000
Fighting with the Ye family
over Sinan's legacy

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.000
is so important,

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.000
but has he ever said anything

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:21.880
or done anything about it?

Mom, you just favor sons over daughters!

00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:26.560
I'm afraid that in the future,

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:27.800
once Sinan's inheritance is divided up,

00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:28.920
you'll just give every penny

00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:30.240
back to Siyu.

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:31.320
Nonsense!

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:34.120
You and Siyu are both my children.

00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:35.520
I love you both equally.

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:38.320
I work so hard planning everything.

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:39.320
What's it all for?

00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:40.810
It's all for both of you!

00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:42.720
And look at you and your husband.

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:45.200
During these 3 years
you managed Mare Nubium,

00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:46.840
how much money have you taken
from the company?

00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:48.640
Do you really think I don't know?

00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:51.320
Mom.

00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:52.380
Mom, you're right.

00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:53.760
Siyue was just

00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:54.640
too anxious

00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:56.360
and speaking nonsense.

00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:58.040
Mom, please don't take it to heart.

00:14:58.040 --> 00:14:59.240
Apologize to Mom now.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:00.600
Siyue.

00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:03.800
The most important thing now

00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:04.680
isn't for our family members

00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:05.760
to argue over who has done what.

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:06.960
Ye Haimeng is coming at us

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:07.920
aggressively,

00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:10.080
and the cards in our hands

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:11.290
are running out.

00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:13.610
We're running out of cards?

We're just getting started.

She's just a naive little girl.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.660
I haven't played my cards yet.

00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:27.680
This time,

00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:29.680
I will not only hold onto

00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:31.040
the 37% of shares

00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:32.880
jointly owned by Sinan and her,

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:34.200
but also make her

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:35.880
understand clearly

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:37.560
that the Lu family

00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:38.920
is not something

00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:40.360
she can easily mess with.

00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:46.160
Come here.

00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:11.440

00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:20.240

00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:22.410
How are you feeling?

00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:24.680
Staying by the seaside,

00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:26.010
I recovered quite well.

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:27.920
But as soon as I got home...

00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:31.680
Dad.

00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:33.840
Why don't we have Mr. Mo

00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:35.570
take you back there for a while?

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:36.400
The air is good there.

00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:37.360
The sunshine is also nice.

00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:38.800
You'll recover faster.

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:42.120
In this family,

00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:43.240
it's still my youngest son

00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:44.770
who cares about me the most.

00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:45.680
Are you

00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:46.640
going out again?

00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:47.040
Yes.

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:49.360
I've scheduled training with a friend.

00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:50.880
His archery club needs investment.

00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:51.680
I want to see

00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:53.320
if I can collaborate with him.

00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:54.480
If you need money,

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:55.760
just tell me.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:57.480
Dad.

00:16:58.040 --> 00:16:59.160
I won a lot of prize money

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:00.400
while I was abroad.

00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:01.800
I've saved it all.

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:02.800
This small amount

00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:04.359
isn't worth your concern.

00:17:04.359 --> 00:17:05.560
In this family,

00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:06.359
you're

00:17:06.359 --> 00:17:08.520
the first one who doesn't ask me
for money.

00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:09.760
It seems like

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.440
my youngest son

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:12.800
gives me less trouble

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:14.040
than Sinan and Siyue.

00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:16.359
Siyu has been abroad
for the past few years

00:17:16.359 --> 00:17:18.040
and has become quite independent.

00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:19.079
But Siyu,

00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:21.400
have you ever thought

00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:23.720
about taking over Changlu Group for me

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:25.319
or replacing your brother Sinan

00:17:25.319 --> 00:17:26.640
at Mare Nubium?

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:27.240
Dad.

00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:29.560
With you at Changlu Group,

00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:31.120
plus several other directors

00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:32.000
and Mr. Mo,

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.660
how could it possibly need me?

00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:35.440
As for

00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:37.000
Mare Nubium,

00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:39.440
I don't think

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:40.840
we should take it back.

Why did you say that?

Mare Nubium

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.800
was originally the Ye family's property.

00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:54.520
It was only after my brother
married Ye Haimeng

00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:55.640

00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:56.770
as shared property.
