[November 26, 2024]
[On the same day as
the Fortune Bank robbery]

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.710
Come over. Something's happened.

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:42.750
Come on.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.200
Everyone, step back.

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.800
Watch out!

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.880
Step back!

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:47.990
Don't come too close!

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:49.840
Step back. Step back.

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:59.640
[November 27, 2024]

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:04.720
Take a look at this video.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.170
The victim seems ordinary,

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:10.120
But after checking his identity,

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:11.120
he's the principal scientist

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.450
of the largest biochemical company here.

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:15.510
His net worth is over 100 million.

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:16.120
Look.

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:19.000
It looks like an accident, doesn't it?

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.510
When we were done with
Fortune Bank's case,

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.200
Division 1's Huang Yuan
checked this billboard.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.060
It hadn't been repaired in years.

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:27.430
After this happened,

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:28.950
all the shops nearby

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.000
checked their signboards immediately.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:31.710
And it turned out

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.039
they were all faulty.

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:36.390
Since it was an accident,

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.590
why did you come to us?

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.229
The family refuses to accept that.

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:44.070
This is the victim's daughter.

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.039
She doesn't believe it was an accident.

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:47.590
She escalated it to our chief

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.590
and has been sitting here
for hours.

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:53.870
We've checked the surveillance cameras

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:54.840
at the scene.

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:58.560
Criminal Division 1 has also done
the preliminary investigation.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.680
Judging from the video,

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:00.710
it really isâ€“

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.920
I know you're going to say
it was an accident,

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.400
but I know it wasn't.

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:06.070
This is a murder case.

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:08.490
Why do you say that?

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:09.430
I have a hunch.

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:10.280
A hunch?

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:12.240
Before my dad left,

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.230
he kept saying he had a hunch.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.079
My dad is a scientist.

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.520
He never believed in
ghosts or gods.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.450
He was never afraid of them either.

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:23.829
But he kept saying he had a hunch.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:25.430
What kind of...

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.000
hunch was it?

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.870
Or rather,

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:30.370
did he receive death threats?

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:31.400
Does he have enemies?

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.130
Or disputes?

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:33.560
None?

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:34.680
Nope...

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:35.710
A month ago,

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:37.360
after Uncle Han died,

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.710
he had a hunch that someone
was going to kill him.

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:40.310
I'm sorry.

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:42.240
But Uncle Han is...

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:44.280
My dad's colleague.

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.230
He's an executive at Moma Group,

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.710
Han Song...

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:52.800
I've heard

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:53.910
of this case.

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.079
It was an electrocution accident

00:02:57.079 --> 00:02:58.480
that Division 1 handled.

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:04.590
Two accidents happening to

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.450
two people from the same company.

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.160
Are these two cases related?

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.250
You said your father's company was...

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:14.630
Moma Biotechnology.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.460
I'm working there now too.

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:17.630
What a coincidence.

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:18.890
An Lan works there too.

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:42.150
Sorry.

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.750
Sir.

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.040
Let's go to the scene.

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.290
Did you find anything suspicious?

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:09.150
No.

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:19.070
Excuse me.

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:21.100
Outsiders are not allowed here.

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:17.830
Sir.

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:19.720
Where was the scene

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.830
of Han Song's case from a month ago?

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.730
What are you thinking of doing?

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:29.600
What are you doing here?

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:30.560
Well.

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.070
Just looking around.

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:33.760
Did you just arrive?

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:34.720
Just got here.

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:38.240
Did you see anything?

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:40.630
No.

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:42.430
Just taking a stroll as I look around

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:44.159
at what the crime scene is like.

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:45.360
Must be tiring.

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:46.270
Not at all.

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:47.830
This is what I should do.

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:49.240
Captain Huang,

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:50.159
can I take a look at
the surveillance footage

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:51.760
from the day of the incident?

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:53.500
What are you thinking?

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:54.070
I'm wondering

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:55.750
if this could have been done by someone.

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:56.680
Done by someone?

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:58.310
The case is closed.

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:00.800
I mean, since I'm already here...

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.480
I know this case is not our business,

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:04.000
but don't be so petty like him.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:04.930
It's just a look.

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:06.120
Done by someone.

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:07.980
Show him if it was done by someone.

A month ago,

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:18.600
Han Song died in an electrocution accident
while on his morning run.

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:20.360
Han Song was doing his morning run

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:21.760
along this road as usual.

After this accident,

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:11.870
we also asked his son, Han Yufei.

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:13.750
Han Song does have a habit of
running every morning,

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:14.870
rain or shine.

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:17.690
Han Song's case happened at...

They are both loop days.

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:42.570
It didn't rain that day?

00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:45.110
It was a nice day out,
like today.

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:57.880
What's your conclusion?

00:07:58.870 --> 00:07:59.750
I think...

00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:01.750
it's not that simple.

[Episode 2]

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:33.320
It wasn't an accident?

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:35.850
How could it be an accident?

00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:40.070
We found fragments from the explosion
near the light box's welding.

00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:44.750
Why did you tell
the family it was an accident?

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
We said it was still under investigation.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:48.960
But the family may have heard

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:50.020
their inferences.

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:50.840
Go on.

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:52.360
Okay.

00:09:53.270 --> 00:09:54.910
Anyway, it's our fault.

00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:57.960
I think an executive from Moma
died last month too.

00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:58.790
I think it was Han Song?

00:09:58.790 --> 00:09:59.840
They said it was an accident too.

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:00.390
Yes.

00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:01.450
It was an accident!

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:02.910
An electrocution accident.

00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:04.150
What happened?

00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:19.360
A typhoon from a few days before

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:20.890
broke and cut a lot of wires.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.200
When the electrician was doing
a routine inspection,

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:24.790
he found that the railing
had electricity leaking through it.

00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:27.250
On his way
to the control room to report this,

00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:29.720
he found Han Song who died
of electrocution.

Chief.

00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:32.160
This was truly an accident.

Peishan.

00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:38.090
What were their roles at Moma?

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:39.630
How are they related?

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:46.480
Tang Shaorong is in charge of research

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:47.750
at Moma.

00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:49.510
Han Song is in charge of operations.

00:10:49.510 --> 00:10:51.320
Both of them have
a background in scientific research.

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:52.240
When they were younger,

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:54.750
they published a paper together with
some of their course mates.

00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:57.030
They were quite famous
in academia back then.

00:10:57.030 --> 00:10:57.630
Chief.

00:10:57.870 --> 00:10:58.550
Chief!

We're in a meeting.

00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:06.630
We received a report.

00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:08.290
It may be related to this case.

reunite with your friends soon.

00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:42.720

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.600
How is he going to make them disappear
in an instant?

00:11:58.600 --> 00:11:59.480
Who is

00:11:59.670 --> 00:12:00.630
this "Squid"?

00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:02.960
Moma is a pharmaceutical company.

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:04.870
Could it be that someone died from medicine?

And they've come to seek revenge now?

00:12:06.630 --> 00:12:08.510
Is it possible that they are competitors?

After all, two executives have died.

00:22:37.790 --> 00:22:38.960
I heard from them that

00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:40.160
if you get the authorization,

00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:41.550
you can tap the whole world?

00:22:41.550 --> 00:22:42.550
Do you have the authorization?

00:22:42.550 --> 00:22:43.400
I do.

00:22:44.270 --> 00:22:45.130
I can too, then.

00:22:46.510 --> 00:22:47.750
Who can have that much authority?

00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:48.950
What do you have then?

00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:01.590
Monitoring equipment?

00:23:01.790 --> 00:23:02.790
Where did you get it?

00:23:02.790 --> 00:23:03.480
I bought it.

00:23:32.750 --> 00:23:33.510
Seven years ago,

00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:34.590
Mo Yuanzhi, a doctor,

00:23:34.590 --> 00:23:35.590
announced that he developed

00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:37.650
a new genetic technology called RAN,

00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:40.050
making him his first huge amount
of money.

00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:43.000
One year later,

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.270
Moma Biotechnology announced

00:23:44.270 --> 00:23:46.720
that the initial development of
RAN-2 was successful.

00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:48.160
In the same year, he married

00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:49.880
the daughter of
the famous investor Yu Yinghua,

00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:50.920
Yu Shiya.

00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:55.830
Officer Ding, right?

00:23:55.830 --> 00:23:56.680
I'm Mo Yuanzhi.

00:23:56.680 --> 00:23:57.200
Hello.

00:23:57.550 --> 00:23:58.480
Don't call me

00:23:58.480 --> 00:23:59.440
Officer for now.

00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:00.350
Call me Qi.

00:24:01.070 --> 00:24:02.270
Sorry for the trouble.

00:24:02.270 --> 00:24:03.680
Can I go take a look at your office?

00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:04.350
Of course.

00:24:06.750 --> 00:24:07.270
Here.

00:24:08.510 --> 00:24:08.970
Please.

00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:11.640
Would you like something to drink?

00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:12.440
Coffee or tea?

00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:13.550
No, thanks.

00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:18.720
Based on your experience,

00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:20.640
when do you think Squid

00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:21.880
will take action?

00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:24.240
It's hard to say.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:26.200
I also want to ask you.

00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:28.440
From your point of view,

00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:29.590
why do you think Squid

00:24:29.590 --> 00:24:30.750
is targeting Moma?

00:24:33.310 --> 00:24:35.160
The production of our genetic medication

00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:37.790
has greatly affected
traditional pharmaceutical companies.

00:24:37.790 --> 00:24:38.240
Even a few years back,

00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:40.370
we'd already made countless enemies.

00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:41.200
And this year,

00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:44.160
we have a project
called RAN-X

00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:46.400
that's about to enter
the clinical trial stage.

00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:47.110
Once the experiment succeeds,

00:24:47.110 --> 00:24:48.000
and it enters the market,

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:49.310
this is no exaggeration,

00:24:49.310 --> 00:24:50.550
but at least half
of these companies

00:24:50.550 --> 00:24:51.590
will be affected.

00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:54.640
Moma has affected too many people.

00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:55.750
People like Squid

00:24:55.750 --> 00:24:57.510
who want to make Moma disappear

00:24:57.790 --> 00:24:58.450
are plenty.

00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:06.330
Please don't mind.

00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:08.780
I'm sorry. This is embarrassing.

00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:10.160
I can only

00:25:10.350 --> 00:25:12.010
commemorate them in this way.

00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:14.880
After all, according to your requirements,

00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:16.030
I can't attend

00:25:16.030 --> 00:25:17.160
Tang's funeral.

00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:21.110
Of course, I know

00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:22.970
you're doing this for my own good.

00:25:24.270 --> 00:25:24.790
In the building,

00:25:24.790 --> 00:25:27.310
there will be other colleagues of mine
protecting you around the clock.

00:25:27.310 --> 00:25:27.880
But...

00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:28.830
let's work together.

00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:30.960
I hope you don't hide anything from us.

00:25:31.030 --> 00:25:32.150
For your safety.

00:25:32.150 --> 00:25:32.750
Okay.

00:25:34.750 --> 00:25:36.610
Let my secretary show you around.

00:25:36.790 --> 00:25:38.200
Can I take a walk by myself?

00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:38.750
Sure.

00:25:39.550 --> 00:25:40.070
Mr. Ding.

00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:41.510
This is the staff pass you requested.

00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:42.440
Okay, thank you.

00:26:00.070 --> 00:26:00.790
Who are you?

00:26:05.030 --> 00:26:06.230
The CEO's assistant?

00:26:09.110 --> 00:26:09.920
A bodyguard?

00:26:10.270 --> 00:26:12.470
The president cherishes his life, huh.

00:26:17.310 --> 00:26:18.720
Why are you here

00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:21.620
instead of being with the CEO?

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:23.030
I just joined today.

00:26:23.030 --> 00:26:24.690
I'm just taking a look around.

00:26:26.790 --> 00:26:27.510
Han Yufei.

00:26:27.510 --> 00:26:29.440
He's the son of the executive
that was murdered, Han Song.

00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:30.880
He's a playboy that does nothing all day.

00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:32.680
He dresses gaudily all day long.

00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:33.790
After his father died,

00:26:33.790 --> 00:26:35.200
he joined Moma Group.

00:26:35.310 --> 00:26:36.070
He has no position,

00:26:36.070 --> 00:26:37.070
but he has shares.

00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:39.960
He is now
the second-largest shareholder of Moma.

00:27:16.830 --> 00:27:17.680
Officer Ding?

00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:25.920
Mr. Ding.

00:27:27.670 --> 00:27:28.920
You're starting work so soon?

00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:30.250
Not going to take a rest?

00:27:31.790 --> 00:27:32.590
I can be calmer

00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:34.450
when I have something to do.

00:27:36.310 --> 00:27:38.160
Thank you for what you did before.

00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:39.360
It's what I should do.

00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:40.550
Ms. Tang.

00:27:41.310 --> 00:27:42.710
I'm getting back to work.

00:27:47.310 --> 00:27:47.960
Tang Xin.

00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:48.820
You've met her.

00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:50.270
She's the daughter of
the principal scientist,

00:27:50.270 --> 00:27:51.270
Tang Shaorong.

00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:53.030
She just graduated from university.

00:27:53.030 --> 00:27:54.960
Three months ago,
she joined Moma Biotechnology

00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:57.090
and started at the bottom as an intern.

00:27:57.160 --> 00:27:58.920
But her father unexpectedly died.

00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:00.790
Her identity right now is very special.

00:28:00.790 --> 00:28:03.240
While she's also at the lowest level,
an intern researcher,

00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:04.070
at the same time,

00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:06.930
she's also
the third-largest shareholder of Moma.

00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:21.590
Why are you here?

00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:24.750
I'm here for work.

00:28:27.590 --> 00:28:29.190
Which floor are you going to?

00:28:29.970 --> 00:28:30.880
I'm...

00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:31.950
Any floor is fine.

00:28:50.590 --> 00:28:52.250
Why are you dressed like this?

00:28:52.510 --> 00:28:53.310
Do I look good?

00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:55.590
Not bad.

00:28:56.550 --> 00:28:57.810
Don't I look like a CEO?

00:29:04.430 --> 00:29:05.690
I'm here to protect...

00:29:06.710 --> 00:29:07.310
your boss.

00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:20.440
This was a bad photo.

00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:24.960
Excuse me.

00:29:25.030 --> 00:29:25.720
Excuse me.

00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:27.040
Thank you.

00:30:18.830 --> 00:30:20.090
You stepped on my foot.

00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:30.790
You stepped on my foot.

00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:32.720
Sorry.

00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:33.860
No problem.

00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:47.810
Does your foot hurt?

00:30:48.790 --> 00:30:49.720
My shoes are big.

00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:14.590
This is Officer Ding,
sent by the police to protect me.

00:31:14.590 --> 00:31:15.650
This is my wife, Ya.

00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:18.920
Thank you, Officer Ding.

00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:21.120
It's what I should do.

00:31:23.110 --> 00:31:24.040
Let's go, honey.

00:31:24.110 --> 00:31:24.590
Okay.

00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:27.280
Officer Ding.

00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:28.880
Take my car.

00:31:41.510 --> 00:31:43.200
Mo Yuanzhi's wife, Yu Shiya,

00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:45.240
is the daughter of a famous investor.

00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:46.720
She's been married to Mo Yuanzhi for six years.

00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:47.960
They don't have any kids.

00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:49.790
If anything happens to Mo Yuanzhi,

00:31:49.790 --> 00:31:51.160
most of his assets

00:31:51.270 --> 00:31:53.240
and shares worth billions

00:31:53.510 --> 00:31:55.240
will be hers.

00:31:56.030 --> 00:31:56.830
Besides,

00:31:57.070 --> 00:31:58.400
with the two special treatments

00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:00.160
that Moma Biotechnology has,

00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:01.970
they can continue to profit

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:03.200
for another 20 years.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:24.600
Thank you.

00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:30.590
Is this your car?

00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:31.400
Yes.

00:32:31.790 --> 00:32:34.390
We usually drive them
when we go out ourselves.

00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:42.680
Officer Ding.

00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:43.880
Take this key card

00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:44.640
for now.

00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:45.830
Okay, thank you.

00:32:47.790 --> 00:32:48.960
Sir, I'm leaving first.

00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:49.640
Thank you.

00:32:52.590 --> 00:32:53.110
Mr. Mo.

00:32:53.750 --> 00:32:55.010
Can you show me around?

00:32:55.030 --> 00:32:55.480
Okay.

00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:57.070
I'll accompany you.

00:32:57.070 --> 00:32:57.600
This way.

00:33:07.510 --> 00:33:08.510
This way, please.

00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:11.000
Take a look.

00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:13.400
Do you want some water, Officer Ding?

00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:14.350
No, thanks.

00:33:31.270 --> 00:33:32.730
Can I take a look upstairs?

00:33:33.750 --> 00:33:34.270
Yes.

00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:10.360
Tell the team

00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:13.070
to strengthen surveillance on
the southeast corner of the yard.

00:34:13.070 --> 00:34:13.760
Roger.

00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:15.360
I've taken a look.

00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:16.159
It seems fine.

00:34:16.670 --> 00:34:17.070
Okay.

00:34:17.070 --> 00:34:17.800
I'll leave you to it.

00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:19.199
Thank you, Officer Ding.

00:34:20.230 --> 00:34:21.110
Just call me Qi.

00:34:22.230 --> 00:34:22.710
Okay.

00:34:23.150 --> 00:34:24.350
See you tomorrow, Qi.

00:34:30.780 --> 00:34:32.900
â™ª If you have five chances
back to the start â™ª

00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:34.139
â™ª Where people get hurt â™ª

00:34:34.170 --> 00:34:35.889
â™ª Or maybe you can try to save the world â™ª

00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:37.150
â™ª This sleepless day's loop â™ª

00:34:37.170 --> 00:34:37.840
â™ª Accompany the rising and falling of
the sun â™ª
