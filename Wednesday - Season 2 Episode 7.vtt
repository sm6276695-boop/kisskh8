[funky calypso lounge music playing]

00:00:29.612 --> 00:00:31.238
[bartender] What can I get you?

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:33.449
[Dort] Three rocks,
two fingers of Jack, and a--

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.034
[bartender] One splash of water.

00:00:35.035 --> 00:00:36.870
You can never go wrong ordering a Sinatra.

00:00:40.331 --> 00:00:42.792
Wait. You look familiar.

00:00:44.044 --> 00:00:47.337
You were in The Crucible
at the Jupiter Dinner Theater.

00:00:47.338 --> 00:00:49.173
Your John Proctor was spellbinding.

00:00:49.174 --> 00:00:53.177
The audience was hanging on
your every word, particularly the ladies.

00:00:53.178 --> 00:00:54.512
You saw that show?

00:00:55.597 --> 00:00:57.556
You're the only one who's ever remembered.

00:00:57.557 --> 00:00:59.641
I haven't seen you at Tiki Tails before.

00:00:59.642 --> 00:01:02.061
- I'm Arnold Hunt.
- Barry Dort.

00:01:02.062 --> 00:01:03.854
I manage one of the Sirens.

00:01:03.855 --> 00:01:05.148
Gabrielle.

00:01:11.279 --> 00:01:15.699
I figured a talented guy like you would be
knocking them dead out in Hollywood.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.118
I mean, you certainly
have the looks, charisma.

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.953
I took my shot in LA.

00:01:19.954 --> 00:01:24.208
Even landed a recurring on a soap opera.
Medical Affairs.

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:28.295
No way. [chuckles] That was
my mom's favorite show, God rest her soul.

00:01:28.296 --> 00:01:30.297
She never missed an episode.

00:01:30.298 --> 00:01:32.716
I played Dr. Gideon Sterling.

00:01:32.717 --> 00:01:35.385
Until my long-lost brother came back
from the dead, stole my wife,

00:01:35.386 --> 00:01:36.970
and they blew me up in my Porsche.

00:01:36.971 --> 00:01:38.555
Tough break.

00:01:38.556 --> 00:01:41.100
Yeah, career took a...
a nosedive after that,

00:01:41.101 --> 00:01:44.020
so I packed up my Corolla
and moved back home.

00:01:45.897 --> 00:01:49.317
Luck is what happens
when preparation meets opportunity.

00:01:49.943 --> 00:01:53.779
And you're in luck because, boy,
do I have the right opportunity for you.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.531
I don't need a manager, pal.

00:01:55.532 --> 00:01:59.284
- Those days are long gone.
- I... I'm talking about something bigger.

00:01:59.285 --> 00:02:01.954
I see a lot of broken people
in my travels,

00:02:01.955 --> 00:02:05.959
especially Outcasts,
and I have ideas how to fix them.

00:02:06.543 --> 00:02:09.920
I want to create a place
where like-minded people come together

00:02:09.921 --> 00:02:13.674
to follow a shared vision
of enlightenment and growth.

00:02:13.675 --> 00:02:14.676
Sounds like a cult.

00:02:15.593 --> 00:02:17.427
Nobody likes the C-word.

00:02:17.428 --> 00:02:20.097
I prefer the term "movement."

00:02:20.098 --> 00:02:22.474
I have an entire business plan,

00:02:22.475 --> 00:02:26.229
and I even wrote an instruction manual

00:02:26.896 --> 00:02:28.481
on how to build a better life.

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.570
I'm self-aware enough to know that
this mug isn't going to convince anyone.

00:02:34.571 --> 00:02:36.947
I've seen you on stage, Arnold.

00:02:36.948 --> 00:02:40.659
You have that indefinable star quality,

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.288
and this is the part
you were born to play.

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:45.289
You're serious.

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.292
You remember The Wizard of Oz.

00:02:47.792 --> 00:02:50.502
I'm like the guy
Toto finds behind the curtain,

00:02:50.503 --> 00:02:52.462
secretly pulling the levers.

00:02:52.463 --> 00:02:55.382
You will be the great and powerful Oz,

00:02:55.383 --> 00:02:57.217
the face of our movement,

00:02:57.218 --> 00:03:00.554
the inspirational leader
who touches people's souls,

00:03:00.555 --> 00:03:03.765
and persuades them
to part with their hard-earned cash

00:03:03.766 --> 00:03:08.313
for a chance to be a part of something
bigger than themselves.

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.982
[intriguing music playing]

00:03:14.903 --> 00:03:16.905
So does this movement have a name?

00:03:19.741 --> 00:03:21.534
How about Morning Song?

00:03:22.243 --> 00:03:25.955
Because every dawn
brings the light of a new day.

00:03:26.915 --> 00:03:28.833
So, what do you say?

00:03:38.885 --> 00:03:40.887
[chilling, suspenseful music playing]

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:00.739
[faint laughter]

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:03.909
[Bianca] No, you can't do that. [laughs]

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:04.994
Here.

00:04:05.578 --> 00:04:07.372
[door creaking open]

00:04:10.333 --> 00:04:13.293
Principal Dort, I can explain.

00:04:13.294 --> 00:04:14.379
[Dort] No need, Bianca.

00:04:15.004 --> 00:04:18.591
Your mother and I go back a long way.

00:04:19.384 --> 00:04:20.425
Don't we, Gabrielle?

00:04:20.426 --> 00:04:21.677
[mysterious music playing]

00:04:21.678 --> 00:04:23.011
[Gabrielle] Ah...

00:04:23.012 --> 00:04:26.849
Who do you think introduced her
to Gideon all those years ago?

00:04:28.309 --> 00:04:29.936
You're part of Morning Song?

00:04:30.895 --> 00:04:32.562
I am Morning Song.

00:04:32.563 --> 00:04:34.564
And we had a good thing going

00:04:34.565 --> 00:04:38.193
until you two poked your tails in
and stirred things up.

00:04:38.194 --> 00:04:40.737
Fortunately, I don't hold grudges.

00:04:40.738 --> 00:04:42.406
What do you want, Barry?

00:04:42.407 --> 00:04:45.868
By my count,
you've been living here rent-free.

00:04:46.953 --> 00:04:49.289
But the free ride is over.

00:04:51.082 --> 00:04:53.792
It's time to get back to work, ladies.

00:04:53.793 --> 00:04:55.335
[music builds to climax]

00:04:55.336 --> 00:04:56.336
[music ends]

00:04:56.337 --> 00:04:58.423
[jauntily macabre music playing]

00:05:05.847 --> 00:05:06.848
[music trails off]

00:05:07.432 --> 00:05:08.850
[indistinct chatter]

00:05:12.937 --> 00:05:15.188
How much longer is this going to take?

00:05:15.189 --> 00:05:18.317
I can't have my guests
arrive to a crime scene.

00:05:18.318 --> 00:05:20.694
I assumed you were canceling the gala,

00:05:20.695 --> 00:05:23.238
out of respect for your late colleague.

00:05:23.239 --> 00:05:27.951
Oh, I know Professor Orloff
would want us to keep calm and Outcast on.

00:05:27.952 --> 00:05:29.536
That's the Nevermore way.

00:05:29.537 --> 00:05:33.081
Doubt anyone's going to show up
once this hits the press.

00:05:33.082 --> 00:05:37.378
Perhaps we can just say there was
an unfortunate classroom accident.

00:05:39.672 --> 00:05:42.924
Do you really want it out there
that the Jericho Sheriff's Department

00:05:42.925 --> 00:05:45.178
still hasn't caught a killer zombie?

00:05:46.304 --> 00:05:47.305
This isn't over.

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:50.432
From now on,
my deputies handle campus security.

00:05:50.433 --> 00:05:52.602
- [scoffs]
- That's a non-negotiable.

00:05:56.689 --> 00:05:57.857
[birds cawing]

00:05:58.691 --> 00:06:02.861
We both know Santiago and her crew have
no chance against two Hydes and a zombie.

00:06:02.862 --> 00:06:04.154
[Santiago] Let's move.

00:06:04.155 --> 00:06:06.699
Your newfound cynicism is refreshing.

00:06:07.658 --> 00:06:09.994
Only you would leave
psychic scar tissue in a body swap.

00:06:11.371 --> 00:06:14.039
Nice try telling me to stay invisible.

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:16.709
Shh, save your apologies.

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:18.668
I'm not even a little sorry.

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:20.837
And you should be grateful
we came to rescue you

00:06:20.838 --> 00:06:22.881
when there's a premonition I'd die.

00:06:22.882 --> 00:06:24.591
And yet it never comes to pass.

00:06:24.592 --> 00:06:26.718
Worst premonition ever.

00:06:26.719 --> 00:06:29.138
- [scoffs]
- The premonition has changed.

00:06:30.014 --> 00:06:31.724
You're no longer the one who dies.

00:06:32.225 --> 00:06:33.810
Really? Yes!

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:38.313
Wait. Who dies?

00:06:38.314 --> 00:06:39.524
An Addams.

00:06:40.149 --> 00:06:43.902
Which is why I need to flush out Isaac and
the Galpin family before he gets to mine.

00:06:43.903 --> 00:06:46.656
Your search may start closer to home.

00:06:54.872 --> 00:06:56.707
- Ahh.
- Mmm!

00:06:57.291 --> 00:06:58.334
Organic.

00:07:02.171 --> 00:07:03.965
[grim music building]

00:07:07.427 --> 00:07:09.886
What has your braids in a twist,
my little tempest?

00:07:09.887 --> 00:07:13.015
The latest exhumation from the growing
secrets you've been keeping from me.

00:07:13.599 --> 00:07:16.477
Not only have you known
the identity of Pugsley's zombie...

00:07:18.855 --> 00:07:20.773
Isaac Night was your roommate.

00:07:21.441 --> 00:07:22.817
He was more than that.

00:07:23.693 --> 00:07:25.360
He was my closest friend.

00:07:25.361 --> 00:07:27.737
Your father was the only one
who could charm his way

00:07:27.738 --> 00:07:29.574
into Isaac's clockwork heart.

00:07:30.158 --> 00:07:34.035
I tried to protect him from people
who wanted to exploit his genius.

00:07:34.036 --> 00:07:35.787
Like Augustus Stonehurst.

00:07:35.788 --> 00:07:38.206
That's why he built
the lab for him in Iago Tower.

00:07:38.207 --> 00:07:42.295
Stonehurst saw him as the key to unlocking
the secrets of Outcast abilities.

00:07:42.879 --> 00:07:44.338
[Gomez] But Isaac...

00:07:45.173 --> 00:07:46.548
had his own plans in mind.

00:07:46.549 --> 00:07:47.632
[Morticia] Hmm.

00:07:47.633 --> 00:07:51.553
He thought he could use science
to extract Francoise's Hyde ability.

00:07:51.554 --> 00:07:54.807
I had no idea
that Isaac was Pugsley's zombie

00:07:55.391 --> 00:07:57.434
until I saw him at Pilgrim World.

00:07:57.435 --> 00:07:59.853
[Wednesday] He's not just
some brainless pet anymore.

00:07:59.854 --> 00:08:01.855
Isaac has fully regenerated.

00:08:01.856 --> 00:08:04.108
And he's reunited
with Francoise and Tyler.

00:08:05.651 --> 00:08:07.612
Who did not leave town as promised.

00:08:08.446 --> 00:08:09.363
[Morticia huffs]

[crunches, gurgles]

00:08:18.998 --> 00:08:22.668
[Morticia] Larissa told me it was you
snooping around here in Enid's body.

00:08:23.461 --> 00:08:25.962
You and Weems have been
conspiring behind my back?

00:08:25.963 --> 00:08:27.964
You went to Rotwood's grave.

00:08:27.965 --> 00:08:30.008
It must have been your grandmama

00:08:30.009 --> 00:08:32.260
who planted that
pernicious idea in your head.

00:08:32.261 --> 00:08:34.639
It may have been pernicious,
but it was enlightening.

00:08:36.224 --> 00:08:38.392
How long have you been writing,
Barbara Jean?

00:08:41.938 --> 00:08:43.940
[plants gurgling]

00:08:46.317 --> 00:08:47.484
Since I was your age.

00:08:47.485 --> 00:08:51.112
But I made the mistake of giving
my mother one of my early efforts.

00:08:51.113 --> 00:08:52.698
The sound of her...

00:08:53.491 --> 00:08:56.117
humiliating cackle still haunts me.

00:08:56.118 --> 00:09:00.872
So, after that I decided
to keep my literary career a secret.

00:09:00.873 --> 00:09:03.500
Your father has no inkling.
That's the way I'd like to keep it.

00:09:03.501 --> 00:09:06.003
My lips are sealed for my own protection.

00:09:06.629 --> 00:09:09.423
I began to profusely vomit
after reading the first five pages.

00:09:11.217 --> 00:09:14.344
Well, perhaps one day

00:09:14.345 --> 00:09:19.516
you'll appreciate the intoxicating power
of weaving mystery and passion.

00:09:19.517 --> 00:09:21.936
We have more pressing
family matters at hand.

00:09:23.312 --> 00:09:24.896
My premonition has changed, Mother.

00:09:24.897 --> 00:09:26.898
Enid no longer dies.

00:09:26.899 --> 00:09:28.067
One of us does.

00:09:28.651 --> 00:09:29.484
An Addams.

00:09:29.485 --> 00:09:31.070
[foreboding music playing]

00:09:33.072 --> 00:09:35.116
I'd like to sacrifice Pugsley.

00:09:37.159 --> 00:09:38.785
Enid, wait.

00:09:38.786 --> 00:09:40.912
Please. I... I've been looking for you.

00:09:40.913 --> 00:09:44.082
I've been avoiding you,
which I'll do for the rest of my life.

00:09:44.083 --> 00:09:47.128
- Let me explain the situation with Sofia.
- Is that your girlfriend's name?

00:09:48.921 --> 00:09:51.339
We decided to take a break
when I came to Nevermore.

00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:54.427
I figured I'd join a new pack here.
I wanted to keep things casual.

00:09:55.428 --> 00:09:57.179
[sighs softly] But then I met someone.

00:09:58.931 --> 00:10:00.473
I can't stop thinking about her.

00:10:00.474 --> 00:10:02.058
I'm not going to compete for you.

00:10:02.059 --> 00:10:04.770
I know. So I finally
broke things off with her last night.

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:09.566
You've been keeping this
a secret all semester.

00:10:09.567 --> 00:10:11.610
I don't know that I can trust you again.

00:10:11.611 --> 00:10:15.072
I'll do whatever it takes.
Can I still escort you to the gala?

00:10:17.074 --> 00:10:19.535
Enid Sinclair, in my classroom now!

00:10:21.370 --> 00:10:24.415
You broke out
of the Lupin cages last night. Why?

00:10:24.999 --> 00:10:27.042
Just wasn't really myself.

00:10:27.043 --> 00:10:29.253
That's not an excuse.

00:10:29.754 --> 00:10:33.882
Becoming an Alpha
isn't something you can take lightly.

00:10:33.883 --> 00:10:36.676
Especially with a full moon in two days.

00:10:36.677 --> 00:10:38.470
That doesn't sound ominous at all.

00:10:38.471 --> 00:10:42.682
If a young Alpha
transforms under a full moon,

00:10:42.683 --> 00:10:46.896
there's a very real chance
you could remain in your werewolf form.

00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:48.898
For how long?

00:10:50.066 --> 00:10:50.983
Wait.

00:10:51.901 --> 00:10:54.235
You mean, like, forever?

00:10:54.236 --> 00:10:55.654
I'm afraid it's worse.

00:10:55.655 --> 00:10:58.239
Alphas who permanently transform,

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:01.493
they're hunted and killed
by other werewolves.

00:11:01.494 --> 00:11:03.620
It's a form of self-policing.

00:11:03.621 --> 00:11:05.330
This is a living nightmare.

00:11:05.331 --> 00:11:08.041
If you follow the precautions,
you should be fine.

00:11:08.042 --> 00:11:12.295
Before sundown, lock yourself
in the Lupin cages and keep calm.

00:11:12.296 --> 00:11:14.881
You're not alone in this, Enid.

00:11:14.882 --> 00:11:17.634
Your pack is your strength.

00:11:17.635 --> 00:11:19.637
[breathing shakily]

00:11:31.065 --> 00:11:32.191
Leaving?

00:11:34.402 --> 00:11:36.861
If you won't give me
permission to kill Wednesday,

00:11:36.862 --> 00:11:38.613
we need to get the hell out of Jericho.

00:11:38.614 --> 00:11:41.825
The Addams family's
not your problem anymore, sweetie.

00:11:41.826 --> 00:11:44.244
We have a bigger plan for them.

00:11:44.245 --> 00:11:45.787
Leave it to your Uncle Isaac.

00:11:45.788 --> 00:11:48.248
Because he's been crushing it so far.

00:11:48.249 --> 00:11:51.251
Every experiment
has unforeseen complications.

00:11:51.252 --> 00:11:52.919
We'll be prepared next time.

00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:55.922
There is no next time.
Your machine was destroyed.

00:11:55.923 --> 00:11:58.508
It doesn't take a genius
to see that you failed.

00:11:58.509 --> 00:12:01.136
The only thing that I care about

00:12:01.137 --> 00:12:03.054
is saving my sister.

00:12:03.055 --> 00:12:05.682
The one factor I don't need
in that equation is you.

00:12:05.683 --> 00:12:08.685
Stop it. The minute
we turn on each other, we're dead.

00:12:08.686 --> 00:12:10.228
One of us is already dead.

00:12:10.229 --> 00:12:12.231
[Francoise coughing]

00:12:13.232 --> 00:12:14.607
Francoise?

00:12:14.608 --> 00:12:15.860
Her medicine, find it.

00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:21.072
It's empty.

00:12:21.073 --> 00:12:22.908
[somber, distraught music playing]

00:12:25.035 --> 00:12:26.328
I need some more.

00:12:28.247 --> 00:12:29.247
[frustrated growl]

00:12:29.248 --> 00:12:32.501
There's an animal hospital in town.
Come with me.

00:12:33.002 --> 00:12:35.212
[Francoise coughing]

00:12:36.130 --> 00:12:38.132
[morbidly intriguing music playing]

00:12:53.105 --> 00:12:54.189
Check in the back.

00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:57.609
We're looking for anything
that can point us to where they're hiding.

00:12:57.610 --> 00:13:00.654
Isaac isn't going anywhere until
he can save his sister from being a Hyde.

00:13:05.409 --> 00:13:07.411
[delicately mysterious music playing]

00:13:09.455 --> 00:13:12.082
All Francoise ever wanted
was a normal life,

00:13:13.584 --> 00:13:15.878
and she had it for a fleeting moment.

00:13:20.049 --> 00:13:25.012
The last time I stood in this room,
she asked me to be her maid of honor.

00:13:26.472 --> 00:13:29.599
I knew she hadn't
told Galpin about her condition,

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:31.143
so I declined.

00:13:32.978 --> 00:13:34.146
We didn't speak again.

00:13:34.772 --> 00:13:37.315
Spare me your saccharine
stroll down memory lane.

00:13:37.316 --> 00:13:39.984
Then perhaps you can tell me
how you plan to take on

00:13:39.985 --> 00:13:42.529
the Galpin family monster mash-up.

00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:45.533
Your sharp tongue won't be
enough to keep them at bay.

00:13:46.116 --> 00:13:48.786
If you're not here to help,
feel free to dissipate.

00:13:50.329 --> 00:13:52.373
[music swells, trails off]

00:14:13.936 --> 00:14:16.146
[suspenseful music playing]

00:14:24.864 --> 00:14:27.616
For a couple of Hydes,
they fled like rats.

00:14:44.842 --> 00:14:48.220
Now I understand why Isaac was
so hell-bent on saving his sister.

00:14:50.222 --> 00:14:51.765
She's running out of time.

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:54.602
[delicate, foreboding music playing]

00:15:05.613 --> 00:15:07.364
[Eugene] A New England corpse moth.

00:15:07.865 --> 00:15:10.700
Extraordinary specimen.
Where'd you find it?

00:15:10.701 --> 00:15:13.369
Following someone's
emotional support zombie.

00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:14.580
You found Slurp?

00:15:17.541 --> 00:15:19.626
Tweezed these from Slurp
when they were larvae.

00:15:19.627 --> 00:15:21.711
Now they're about to enter
their migratory phase.

00:15:21.712 --> 00:15:24.130
- What's that?
- When they return to their host body.

00:15:24.131 --> 00:15:26.507
- To lay their eggs.
- What if the body's on the run?

00:15:26.508 --> 00:15:28.509
[sighs] I bet they can still find it.

00:15:28.510 --> 00:15:31.095
Insect GPS beats Google Maps
every day of the week.

00:15:31.096 --> 00:15:32.764
I just wanted a friend.

00:15:32.765 --> 00:15:34.307
What, couldn't find one with a pulse?

00:15:34.308 --> 00:15:37.144
I tried, okay? But no one was interested.

00:15:38.562 --> 00:15:40.105
[melancholy music playing]

00:15:41.982 --> 00:15:42.942
[sighs]

00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:51.783
Go find your host.

00:15:51.784 --> 00:15:53.869
[enigmatic, intriguing music playing]

00:16:05.422 --> 00:16:07.758
[faint police radio chatter]

00:16:08.801 --> 00:16:09.802
Hey.

00:16:10.552 --> 00:16:14.598
I saw this and went to go check on
your mom, but she's not in the room.

00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:16.849
She was afraid Gideon was onto her.

00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:20.186
And now that the sheriff has deputies
crawling all over campus,

00:16:20.187 --> 00:16:22.605
it was a matter of time
before she was discovered.

00:16:22.606 --> 00:16:23.898
Wait, she left?

00:16:23.899 --> 00:16:25.316
But where's she going?

00:16:25.317 --> 00:16:26.443
I'm not sure.

00:16:27.152 --> 00:16:29.028
She thought it was better I didn't know.

00:16:29.029 --> 00:16:31.573
It wouldn't be the first time
she's disappeared on me.

00:16:32.199 --> 00:16:34.242
At least now
you don't have to worry about us.

00:16:34.243 --> 00:16:36.829
Bianca. What's going on?

00:16:38.163 --> 00:16:40.916
Ms. Barclay, can I see you in my office?

00:16:44.086 --> 00:16:46.714
Just drop it, okay?

00:16:47.673 --> 00:16:49.842
It's better for everyone this way.

00:16:52.344 --> 00:16:54.346
[cryptic music playing]

00:16:57.433 --> 00:16:58.434
[door opens]

[music trails off]

00:17:01.603 --> 00:17:02.813
Grandmama?

00:17:04.106 --> 00:17:06.274
I'm just biding my time
enjoying your novel.

00:17:06.275 --> 00:17:08.985
Viper's mother, Dominica,
is pitch perfect.

00:17:08.986 --> 00:17:10.987
How do you describe her?

00:17:10.988 --> 00:17:12.697
"A clingy stay-at-home optimist

00:17:12.698 --> 00:17:16.075
that makes Viper want to
shed her skin more times than a cobra."

00:17:16.076 --> 00:17:17.786
[indulgent laughter]

00:17:18.287 --> 00:17:21.873
Speaking of your mother,
she crystal balled me earlier.

00:17:21.874 --> 00:17:25.209
Gave me an earful about steering you
to Professor Rotwood's grave.

00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:26.711
Said there were complications.

00:17:26.712 --> 00:17:28.755
I'm just relieved that you're unscathed.

00:17:28.756 --> 00:17:30.673
Neither of us have an iota of compassion.

00:17:30.674 --> 00:17:32.550
It's one of our most endearing traits.

00:17:32.551 --> 00:17:34.511
Tell me what really
brings you to Nevermore.

00:17:35.804 --> 00:17:38.014
Your weasel of a principal
called last night.

00:17:38.015 --> 00:17:40.892
I've heard kidnapping victims
sound less desperate.

00:17:40.893 --> 00:17:44.270
He's offering me the moon
to donate to your mother's gala.

00:17:44.271 --> 00:17:46.230
I thought that ship had sailed, capsized,

00:17:46.231 --> 00:17:48.191
and sunk to the bottom
of the Mariana Trench.

00:17:48.192 --> 00:17:51.028
Of course it has. But you know what I say...

00:17:52.071 --> 00:17:54.989
The bigger the offer,
the sweeter the grovel.

00:17:54.990 --> 00:17:57.575
You want to see the whites
of his eyes when you reject him.

00:17:57.576 --> 00:18:01.370
There are few greater thrills
than witnessing the exact moment

00:18:01.371 --> 00:18:03.540
when a man's spirit is broken.

00:18:04.792 --> 00:18:06.834
Time to put Dort out of his misery.

00:18:06.835 --> 00:18:09.755
If he hasn't drowned
in his flop sweat already.

00:18:10.339 --> 00:18:11.173
[Hester] Um...

00:18:12.341 --> 00:18:15.469
Perhaps what you and your mother need
is a break from each other.

00:18:15.969 --> 00:18:17.470
Come stay with me for the summer.

00:18:17.471 --> 00:18:19.722
I could teach you
about the family business.

00:18:19.723 --> 00:18:23.309
I realize you're going to be
a literary enfant terrible,

00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:24.853
but death is recession proof.

00:18:25.729 --> 00:18:26.939
Thank you, Grandmama.

00:18:28.857 --> 00:18:31.109
I knew you'd come
under my black wing eventually.

00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:32.693
You may be an Addams,

00:18:32.694 --> 00:18:34.613
but you're a Frump at heart.

00:18:35.239 --> 00:18:36.865
What little heart you have.

00:18:40.035 --> 00:18:41.202
Hester Frump,

00:18:41.203 --> 00:18:45.164
it's an honor to have
the duchess of the dearly departed

00:18:45.165 --> 00:18:47.625
haunt the halls of Nevermore once again.

00:18:47.626 --> 00:18:51.588
Savor it.
I expect this visit to be brief and final.

00:18:52.256 --> 00:18:54.173
Then I won't waste another second.

00:18:54.174 --> 00:18:55.424
As I said on the phone,

00:18:55.425 --> 00:18:58.302
your generosity will not only
ensure our future,

00:18:58.303 --> 00:19:02.181
but will build a monument
to your life and work.

00:19:02.182 --> 00:19:03.599
Introducing...

00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:05.810
[grandiose fanfare trumpeting]

Frump Tower.

00:19:12.985 --> 00:19:15.570
Nevermore will be the preeminent academy

00:19:15.571 --> 00:19:19.157
for tomorrow's morticians,
embalmers, and funeral directors.

00:19:19.158 --> 00:19:22.326
This will include
updating the campus cemetery

00:19:22.327 --> 00:19:24.787
with Frump-branded headstones,

00:19:24.788 --> 00:19:29.083
and replacing the orchard
with a body farm.

00:19:29.084 --> 00:19:32.128
Death, Nevermore, and Frump.

00:19:32.129 --> 00:19:35.298
- Can you think of a more unholy trinity?
- [Hester chuckles]

00:19:35.299 --> 00:19:37.550
A masterful presentation.

00:19:37.551 --> 00:19:40.512
My ego has never been
more expertly stroked.

00:19:41.388 --> 00:19:43.848
But flattery is like formaldehyde.

00:19:43.849 --> 00:19:46.268
It is to be sniffed, never swallowed.

00:19:46.977 --> 00:19:49.020
Which is why I have zero intention

00:19:49.021 --> 00:19:52.774
of giving one cold cent
to this moth-eaten dump.

00:19:57.487 --> 00:19:58.739
It was worth a shot.

[door opens]

00:20:01.491 --> 00:20:05.579
Bianca, would you please
escort Ms. Frump to her car?

00:20:06.997 --> 00:20:09.791
You will leave
your entire fortune to Nevermore.

00:20:10.292 --> 00:20:11.584
That is your legacy.

00:20:11.585 --> 00:20:14.587
You will present this decision
to your family and the world

00:20:14.588 --> 00:20:16.297
without raising suspicion.

00:20:16.298 --> 00:20:18.257
You will attend the gala
as the guest of honor.

- It's an emergency. A car hit my dog.

00:20:49.581 --> 00:20:52.333
- I can't move him by myself. Please.
- Where is he? Let's...

00:20:52.334 --> 00:20:53.501
[vet grunts]

00:20:53.502 --> 00:20:55.587
[chilling music playing]

00:21:01.134 --> 00:21:02.135
[wet crunching]

00:21:07.975 --> 00:21:09.517
You said she needs a transfusion.

00:21:09.518 --> 00:21:12.353
The pills they gave her at Willow Hill
suppressed her Hyde gene,

00:21:12.354 --> 00:21:13.981
thus prolonging her life.

00:21:14.523 --> 00:21:17.317
And when she transformed to save you,

00:21:18.235 --> 00:21:20.361
it must have exacerbated her condition.

00:21:20.362 --> 00:21:22.530
Are you saying this is my fault?
I'm killing her?

00:21:22.531 --> 00:21:23.656
No.

00:21:23.657 --> 00:21:26.200
But delaying her treatment will.

00:21:26.201 --> 00:21:28.244
What your mother needs is blood.

00:21:28.245 --> 00:21:29.745
Hyde blood.

00:21:29.746 --> 00:21:30.831
Roll up your sleeve.

00:21:34.459 --> 00:21:35.459
[chilling music subsides]

00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:37.461
[elegant, lilting music rises]

00:21:37.462 --> 00:21:39.548
[indistinct chatter]

00:21:56.231 --> 00:21:58.317
I know you're here, Larissa.

00:21:59.484 --> 00:22:02.486
[Weems] The gala will no doubt
be a rousing success.

00:22:02.487 --> 00:22:05.698
Morticia Addams will save Nevermore.

00:22:05.699 --> 00:22:11.037
And the Larissa Weems era
will be buried once and for all.

00:22:11.038 --> 00:22:14.749
It's never been my intention
to overshadow your achievements.

00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:16.126
And yet,

00:22:16.793 --> 00:22:19.212
it always ends up happening.

00:22:20.714 --> 00:22:22.257
What has Wednesday done now?

00:22:23.258 --> 00:22:25.135
It's not her this time.

00:22:27.346 --> 00:22:32.142
Your mother is using your estrangement
to pull Wednesday closer to her.

00:22:33.101 --> 00:22:35.811
I envied so much of your life, Morticia.

00:22:35.812 --> 00:22:38.105
But not your relationship
with that old bat.

00:22:38.106 --> 00:22:41.609
- Thank you for saying so.
- [chuckles] Don't thank me yet.

00:22:41.610 --> 00:22:43.362
You're more like your mother
than you think.

00:22:43.945 --> 00:22:44.862
[scoffs]

00:22:44.863 --> 00:22:47.698
I'm talking about your pathological
predilection for secrets.

00:22:47.699 --> 00:22:50.326
Larissa, that's completely unfair.

00:22:50.327 --> 00:22:51.327
Is it?

00:22:51.328 --> 00:22:54.455
You have failed
to be forthcoming with Wednesday

00:22:54.456 --> 00:22:59.211
about your true relationship
with Francoise and Isaac.

00:23:00.504 --> 00:23:02.129
Her vision has changed.

00:23:02.130 --> 00:23:04.758
An Addams dies now.

00:23:05.592 --> 00:23:09.804
Don't let this rip apart the family
you've spent your life trying to protect.

00:23:09.805 --> 00:23:11.264
Tell her the truth

00:23:12.391 --> 00:23:14.226
before tragedy strikes.

00:23:19.356 --> 00:23:22.734
If I have to spend my nights in this cage,
I should make it feel like home.

00:23:25.445 --> 00:23:27.947
- How goes the Hyde hunt?
- I put some feelers out.

00:23:27.948 --> 00:23:31.201
They should be honing in
on Isaac's rotting flesh as we speak.

00:23:33.495 --> 00:23:34.496
What's wrong, Enid?

00:23:37.207 --> 00:23:39.126
Fun fact I learned today.

00:23:39.876 --> 00:23:42.420
If a young Alpha wolfs out on a full moon,

00:23:42.421 --> 00:23:45.590
there's a high chance
that I could never change back.

00:23:46.091 --> 00:23:50.094
Like ever. And if that isn't enough,
I'll be hunted by other werewolves.

00:23:50.095 --> 00:23:53.639
The full moon is in two days.
How are you supposed to prevent that?

00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:57.643
By staying calm. Trying to distract myself
with things that make me happy.

00:23:57.644 --> 00:23:59.478
Like, picking a dress for the gala.

00:23:59.479 --> 00:24:01.772
For a gala you aren't going to attend?

00:24:01.773 --> 00:24:03.233
Bruno asked me.

00:24:03.817 --> 00:24:04.984
As a friend.

00:24:04.985 --> 00:24:07.570
Capri granted me an exception
for my dance routine,

00:24:07.571 --> 00:24:09.281
as long as I lock up afterwards.

00:24:12.492 --> 00:24:15.327
Capri said I didn't have to face
this Alpha business on my own.

00:24:15.328 --> 00:24:17.246
That my strength is in my pack.

00:24:17.247 --> 00:24:18.539
But the truth is...

00:24:18.540 --> 00:24:20.166
[tender, emotional music playing]

00:24:20.167 --> 00:24:21.710
...you are my pack, Wednesday.

00:24:22.919 --> 00:24:24.336
[inhales, exhales sharply]

00:24:24.337 --> 00:24:29.009
If I wolfed out and couldn't,
you know, change back,

00:24:30.969 --> 00:24:32.596
would you come and find me?

00:24:34.514 --> 00:24:36.933
I have no problem hunting you down.

00:24:37.517 --> 00:24:39.727
[emotional music swells]

00:24:39.728 --> 00:24:41.604
- [Enid] Ajax!
- Bianca's in trouble.

00:24:41.605 --> 00:24:43.732
Have you heard of Gideon Sterling?

00:24:44.733 --> 00:24:48.277
I can't believe Bianca had a whole
crime drama going on and none of us knew!

00:24:48.278 --> 00:24:49.570
Now her mom's missing.

00:24:49.571 --> 00:24:51.113
I think that Dort's involved.

00:24:51.114 --> 00:24:54.033
Sheriff Santiago and her deputies
are crawling all around the campus.

00:24:54.034 --> 00:24:55.452
We have to tell someone!

00:24:57.996 --> 00:24:59.623
Dort thinks we're in the dark.

00:25:00.832 --> 00:25:02.626
I do my best work in the dark.

00:25:06.713 --> 00:25:07.838
Wednesday.

00:25:07.839 --> 00:25:09.174
Perfect timing.

00:25:10.634 --> 00:25:12.219
Come look at my new tower.

00:25:13.178 --> 00:25:16.931
Oh, that's just the tip
of the Frump philanthropic iceberg.

00:25:16.932 --> 00:25:19.600
You said the only charity in life
was a quick, painless death.

00:25:19.601 --> 00:25:21.936
Since my own family has little interest

00:25:21.937 --> 00:25:24.772
in the empire I've built
one grave at a time,

00:25:24.773 --> 00:25:27.650
I've decided all my spoils should be used

00:25:27.651 --> 00:25:30.319
to educate future generations of Outcasts.

00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:32.780
Can you believe this woman's generosity?

00:25:32.781 --> 00:25:34.031
No.

00:25:34.032 --> 00:25:35.115
I can't.

00:25:35.116 --> 00:25:37.743
I'm still gonna inherit
your vintage car collection, right?

00:25:37.744 --> 00:25:39.703
Not even a rusty hubcap, my darling.

00:25:39.704 --> 00:25:42.331
Our door has always
been open to you, Hester.

00:25:42.332 --> 00:25:45.751
You're the one who boycotted our wedding,
and declined invitations

00:25:45.752 --> 00:25:47.545
to all family gatherings.

00:25:47.546 --> 00:25:51.299
I'm done with arguing about the past.
I only care about the future.

00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:55.803
What Principal Dort and I have planned
will get Nevermore back on track.

00:25:55.804 --> 00:26:00.015
Like barring Outcasts
without an ability from enrollment.

00:26:00.016 --> 00:26:02.434
Like that inadequate husband of yours.

00:26:02.435 --> 00:26:05.187
Being an Outcast is a state of mind.

00:26:05.188 --> 00:26:08.774
No, dear. That's a platitude losers say
to make them feel like winners.

00:26:08.775 --> 00:26:12.945
Let's just celebrate the fact
that Nevermore's future is secure.

00:26:12.946 --> 00:26:14.698
Group selfie? [Dort chuckles]

00:26:17.325 --> 00:26:19.536
[Dort] You, uh... Oh.

00:26:22.581 --> 00:26:23.582
[Bianca grunting]

00:26:39.139 --> 00:26:42.308
Wednesday. I thought you were
taking a break from the team.

00:26:42.309 --> 00:26:43.602
Sabbatical's over.

00:26:44.102 --> 00:26:46.103
[tense music pulsing]

00:26:46.104 --> 00:26:47.564
[Bianca pants]

00:26:50.150 --> 00:26:51.192
En garde.

00:27:00.452 --> 00:27:04.163
- I've barely seen you all semester.
- We have different extracurriculars.

00:27:04.164 --> 00:27:06.540
You do comas. I do a cappella.

00:27:06.541 --> 00:27:07.626
And galas.

00:27:08.668 --> 00:27:10.712
You've taken to those
like a Siren to water.

00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:18.511
Your mother deserves most of the credit.

00:27:19.012 --> 00:27:21.305
Her attention to detail is incredible.

00:27:21.306 --> 00:27:24.267
- I enjoyed working with her.
- Speaking of mothers, how's yours?

00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:27.394
Haven't seen her since the summer.

00:27:27.395 --> 00:27:29.981
You missed her when she was hiding
in that classroom off the quad?

00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:36.070
I don't know what Ajax told you,
but stay out of it!

00:27:36.071 --> 00:27:38.907
You've involved my family,
so that's an impossibility.

00:27:41.284 --> 00:27:43.535
Dort is blackmailing you
and your mother, isn't he?

00:27:43.536 --> 00:27:45.330
That's why you Siren-songed
my grandmother.

00:27:45.914 --> 00:27:49.083
The four horsemen of the apocalypse would
have to gallop through her tombstones

00:27:49.084 --> 00:27:51.211
before that woman
gave a cent to this school.

00:27:55.632 --> 00:27:58.510
[music builds, steadies]

00:28:00.553 --> 00:28:03.473
I thought I had freed
my mom from my stepfather.

00:28:04.307 --> 00:28:07.394
But it turns out,
Gideon is just the frontman.

00:28:08.436 --> 00:28:10.480
And Dort is behind it all.

00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:13.316
He was playing everyone from the start.

00:28:15.527 --> 00:28:17.779
He plans to steal
your grandmother's fortune.

00:28:20.115 --> 00:28:21.741
You should have come to me.

00:28:22.617 --> 00:28:24.494
Even Wednesday Addams
can't save me from this.

00:28:25.912 --> 00:28:28.206
I'm sorry, but I had no choice.

00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:30.374
And I still don't.

00:28:30.375 --> 00:28:34.378
You won't remember this conversation,
or anything you know about my mother.

00:28:34.379 --> 00:28:37.172
Nothing about the gala
is suspicious to you.

00:28:37.173 --> 00:28:39.717
[emphatically] Let it go.

00:28:39.718 --> 00:28:41.176
[entrancing melody playing]

00:28:41.177 --> 00:28:42.262
[footsteps receding]

00:28:44.931 --> 00:28:45.931
[Agnes laughs]

00:28:45.932 --> 00:28:47.517
You called it perfectly.

00:28:48.017 --> 00:28:51.020
- What'd she say?
- [Agnes] Exactly what you predicted.

00:28:51.521 --> 00:28:55.859
Bianca confessed she's being blackmailed
by Dort and some guy named Gideon.

00:28:56.359 --> 00:29:00.696
- Then she Siren-songed me into forgetting.
- We really do make a great team, don't we?

00:29:00.697 --> 00:29:02.364
Show yourself, Agnes.

00:29:02.365 --> 00:29:03.575
[whoosh]

00:29:04.784 --> 00:29:06.618
Now that your premonition changed,

00:29:06.619 --> 00:29:08.662
and Enid isn't dying,

00:29:08.663 --> 00:29:11.666
I knew I had to step up my game
to become your best friend.

00:29:13.001 --> 00:29:14.669
By raiding my closet?

00:29:16.337 --> 00:29:18.380
I did this for you.

00:29:18.381 --> 00:29:20.507
I wanted to show you
how much you mean to me.

00:29:20.508 --> 00:29:21.717
You failed.

00:29:21.718 --> 00:29:23.887
[distraught music playing]

00:29:26.973 --> 00:29:28.682
[whimpers softly]

00:29:28.683 --> 00:29:29.768
[bell tolling]

00:29:31.436 --> 00:29:33.687
[Francoise whispering]
This is very important to me, Isaac.

00:29:33.688 --> 00:29:35.148
[Isaac] I know it is.

00:29:35.899 --> 00:29:36.858
I know.

00:29:37.442 --> 00:29:39.819
- Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
- [Tyler] Mom.

00:29:40.528 --> 00:29:42.279
- Hey, sweetie.
- You're alive.

00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:45.324
- I am. Thanks to you.
- [Isaac] You've been out for hours.

00:29:45.325 --> 00:29:46.617
We gotta get moving.

00:29:46.618 --> 00:29:47.951
What's the plan?

00:29:47.952 --> 00:29:49.536
We save your mother,

00:29:49.537 --> 00:29:52.832
and we make the Addams Family
pay for their sins.

00:29:56.586 --> 00:29:58.505
I've got a surprise for you.

00:30:05.678 --> 00:30:06.679
[Bianca] Gideon.

00:30:10.433 --> 00:30:12.893
The first family of Morning Song,

00:30:12.894 --> 00:30:14.479
back together again.

00:30:16.147 --> 00:30:19.066
By the time Hester Frump
wakes up tomorrow,

00:30:19.067 --> 00:30:22.070
her fortune will be gone,
and we'll be on a private plane.

00:30:22.570 --> 00:30:23.821
Viva Venezuela!

00:30:23.822 --> 00:30:27.074
I'm not spending a minute with this brat
after she sold me out to the feds.

00:30:27.075 --> 00:30:29.076
Hey, hey. No finger-pointing.

00:30:29.077 --> 00:30:30.661
Mistakes were made all around.

00:30:30.662 --> 00:30:32.871
It's my name and picture
all over the news.

00:30:32.872 --> 00:30:36.500
I told you to stay put,
but you decided to run.

00:30:36.501 --> 00:30:39.837
I think I know why
they wrote you off that soap opera.

00:30:39.838 --> 00:30:41.088
You go off script.

and I'm the student gala coordinator.

00:42:46.855 --> 00:42:48.649
[student] Yeah, Bianca!

00:42:54.947 --> 00:42:57.949
Tonight was only possible
thanks to the tireless efforts

00:42:57.950 --> 00:43:00.243
of two very special Outcasts,

00:43:00.244 --> 00:43:03.246
Gala Chairwoman, Morticia Addams,

00:43:03.247 --> 00:43:06.375
and our very own Principal Dort.

00:43:07.793 --> 00:43:09.460
[scattered cheers]

00:43:09.461 --> 00:43:11.338
Please, join me on stage.

00:43:15.884 --> 00:43:17.511
[Dort] Oh! [laughs awkwardly]

00:43:19.722 --> 00:43:21.682
Before I introduce our guest of honor,

00:43:22.933 --> 00:43:24.435
Principal Dort...

00:43:25.519 --> 00:43:27.103
[inhales deeply]

00:43:27.104 --> 00:43:28.605
...please...

00:43:28.606 --> 00:43:32.067
tell everyone exactly
how this gala came together.

00:43:32.901 --> 00:43:36.946
[echoing] ...tell everyone exactly
how this gala came together...

00:43:36.947 --> 00:43:39.617
[entrancing melody playing]

00:43:45.873 --> 00:43:47.082
It started when I...

00:43:49.293 --> 00:43:53.838
ordered Bianca Barclay
to Siren Morticia Addams

00:43:53.839 --> 00:43:56.675
into asking her mother
for a large donation.

00:43:58.427 --> 00:44:00.887
- [audience murmuring]
- [gulping nervously]

00:44:00.888 --> 00:44:02.181
[clears throat]

00:44:02.681 --> 00:44:04.224
And when that didn't work,

00:44:04.975 --> 00:44:07.226
I held Bianca's mother hostage

00:44:07.227 --> 00:44:10.104
to force her to Siren Hester Frump

00:44:10.105 --> 00:44:12.357
to donate her fortune.

00:44:12.358 --> 00:44:13.483
[outraged gasps]

00:44:13.484 --> 00:44:15.319
[student] Are you out of your mind?

00:44:16.654 --> 00:44:20.531
Also, I promised
my Morning Song stooge, Gideon,

00:44:20.532 --> 00:44:22.492
that I would split the money.

00:44:22.493 --> 00:44:24.286
But I'm not big into sharing,

00:44:25.829 --> 00:44:28.247
so now he's a pile of ash in my fireplace,

00:44:28.248 --> 00:44:30.042
and I'm keeping all the cash.

00:44:30.542 --> 00:44:32.169
[audience clamoring]

00:44:36.256 --> 00:44:37.257
Oh, boy.

00:44:39.176 --> 00:44:40.844
- [Dort] All right!
- [Morticia gasps]

00:44:42.721 --> 00:44:45.557
I'm walking out of here,
or the Siren's toast!

00:44:48.102 --> 00:44:50.145
Back off! Stand back!

00:44:50.896 --> 00:44:51.980
I mean it!

00:44:54.566 --> 00:44:56.025
[dramatic music swells]

00:44:56.026 --> 00:44:57.569
[Gomez gasps]

00:45:00.781 --> 00:45:01.782
[Ajax] Dort!

00:45:03.117 --> 00:45:04.910
[hissing]

00:45:19.174 --> 00:45:21.217
[dramatic music crescendos, trails off]

00:45:21.218 --> 00:45:22.428
[crowd gasps]

00:45:24.680 --> 00:45:26.557
[delighted laughter]

00:45:27.391 --> 00:45:28.726
Oh, bravo!

00:45:30.811 --> 00:45:33.313
Now that's what I call a thrilling climax.

00:45:38.193 --> 00:45:40.695
[Bianca] I don't know
how you hacked my Siren song,

00:45:40.696 --> 00:45:42.113
but thank you.

00:45:42.114 --> 00:45:44.241
I'm not the one you should be thanking.

00:45:49.830 --> 00:45:51.915
I owe you one, Ajax.

00:45:55.753 --> 00:45:57.755
You really rocked his world.

00:46:00.048 --> 00:46:03.384
I'm looking forward
to having your company this summer.

00:46:03.385 --> 00:46:06.971
It will give me an excuse
to decamp the bats from the guest wing.

00:46:06.972 --> 00:46:10.850
After the vile comment you made
about my father, I'm canceling my plans.

00:46:10.851 --> 00:46:12.352
I've lost my ability.

00:46:12.978 --> 00:46:14.979
Does that make me less of an Outcast?

00:46:14.980 --> 00:46:17.899
Don't be ridiculous.
You're just going through a phase.

00:46:17.900 --> 00:46:20.276
My father has many infuriating habits,

00:46:20.277 --> 00:46:22.946
but when it comes to being an Outcast,
there's none finer.

00:46:23.447 --> 00:46:25.156
If you would like me to reconsider,

00:46:25.157 --> 00:46:29.620
you must make a very sizable donation
to Nevermore in his honor.

00:46:30.662 --> 00:46:32.455
Are you resorting to emotional blackmail?

00:46:32.456 --> 00:46:34.416
There's nothing emotional about it.

00:46:35.167 --> 00:46:36.710
It's just blackmail.

00:46:37.836 --> 00:46:40.088
[indulgent laughter] Done.

00:46:41.173 --> 00:46:43.090
Only you could throw a gala

00:46:43.091 --> 00:46:47.136
that begins with a fiery murder
and ends with a shattering death.

00:46:47.137 --> 00:46:49.305
- Well played, my dear.
- You're not upset?

00:46:49.306 --> 00:46:51.307
Almost being conned
out of my entire fortune

00:46:51.308 --> 00:46:53.976
was the biggest rush I've had in years.

00:46:53.977 --> 00:46:55.813
I actually feel alive.

00:46:56.438 --> 00:46:58.899
[mischievous music playing]

00:47:11.787 --> 00:47:14.121
Wednesday! Isaac... he's here.

00:47:14.122 --> 00:47:16.333
- Where?
- At the Nevermore graveyard.

00:47:17.709 --> 00:47:18.710
Pugsley.

00:47:19.586 --> 00:47:20.879
Where's Pugsley?

00:47:24.466 --> 00:47:26.051
[eerie music playing]

00:47:32.766 --> 00:47:33.767
[Pugsley chuckles]

00:47:41.149 --> 00:47:42.860
Hello, old friend.

00:47:44.778 --> 00:47:45.654
Slurp?

00:47:46.947 --> 00:47:47.990
Is that you?

00:47:55.706 --> 00:47:56.790
Pugsley,

00:47:58.500 --> 00:48:00.127
I hate to ask but...

00:48:02.170 --> 00:48:03.547
I need your help.

00:48:07.342 --> 00:48:08.467
[jarring stinger]

00:48:08.468 --> 00:48:09.468
[muffled struggling]

00:48:09.469 --> 00:48:12.264
[sinister music building]

00:48:13.223 --> 00:48:14.099
[Wednesday] Pugsley!

00:48:17.811 --> 00:48:18.854
Pugsley?

00:48:21.523 --> 00:48:22.524
Pugsley!

00:48:34.328 --> 00:48:35.329
[music trails off]

00:48:36.330 --> 00:48:38.332
[jauntily macabre outro music playing]
