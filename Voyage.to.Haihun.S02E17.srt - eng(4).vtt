=Voyage to Haihun, Season 2=

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.300
=Episode 17=

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.200
The second item

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.290
is this.

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:32.520
Jade she-shaped pendant.

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.640
This proves I once was the Emperor.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.280
Qingge.

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:42.490
Keep it safe for me.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:47.430
I once held

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.510
the honor of a sovereign.

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.140
My reign lasted only 27 days,

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.470
but I was still the Emperor.

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:59.780
However,

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.510
life is ever-changing.

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:05.840
Your days aren't over yet.

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:08.100
There will be plenty of chances for joy.

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.750
The third thing

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.470
is this Chi Niu Jade Seal.

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:17.590
Qingge,

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:20.890
make sure to place it inside.

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.560
I kept this with me
at all times in Changyi.

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:32.800
Marquis...

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.960
It's the emblem of me
as the Duke of Changyi.

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.150
Thinking back now,

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.110
I find those days

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.860
the happiest of my life.

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.470
These three things alone

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.760
sum up my 30 years in this world.

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.400
When you look at it this way,

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:03.010
it all seems

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:04.250
so hasty

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.870
and rushed.

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.930
Marquis...

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:18.810
If there's another life,

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.460
I'd choose an ordinary family

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.530
and become a little child,

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:29.440
living a safe and steady life,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.260
and keeping things simple.

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:35.170
Heng.

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:36.350
Remember:

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:38.910
the ink-inscribed gold ingot

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:40.870
may be more

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:42.880
but never less

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:45.930
than this number.

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:47.980
Got it, 100.

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:50.960
1,000?

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:52.500
- 100,000.
- 100,000?

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:53.960
Better more than less.

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:56.750
You've recovered?

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:09.280
What kind of drama are you playing now?

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:10.720
Stop acting.

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:12.530
My chest feels tight.

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:14.310
Marquis.

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:16.560
I just examined it for you.

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:18.040
Nothing serious at all.

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:20.470
Go ahead, speak.

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:22.040
What else do you need?

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:23.680
For such a grand project,

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.190
the choice of overseer

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:28.560
is of the utmost importance.

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:30.560
When I realize

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.680
I have no one of my own there,

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.600
my heart truly

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:38.150
aches.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.480
Then leave it to Lord Sun.

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:40.560
He's one of us.

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:43.560
No?

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:45.190
Then let De Jiu handle it.

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:46.930
She's skilled in combat and meticulous.

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.030
The mausoleum defines my entire life.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:59.080
Heng,

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:02.880
can you truly bear

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:07.420
to let such a heavy task fall
into others' hands?

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:12.420
Can you rest assured?

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:14.700
You're trying to guilt-trip me.

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:17.030
Heng.

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.190
Just say yes to me, will you?

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.260
I knew you'd be waiting here for me.

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:26.950
If you don't agree,

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:28.520
my heart

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.850
will ache endlessly.

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:34.700
Go act spoiled with Qingge.

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:36.240
That trick doesn't work on me.

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:37.520
Let's go.

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:38.790
Heng.

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:40.880
You're really leaving?

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:43.420
Aren't you worried my heart will ache?

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:45.550
News from the Palace days ago.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.570
His Majesty will soon arrive in Yuzhang.

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:49.420
His Majesty is coming?

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:50.590
Yeah.

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:53.150
His Majesty has two purposes
for this journey.

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:54.560
First, an incognito inspection.

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:56.200
It's to observe the people's conditions.

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:57.100
Second,

00:05:58.390 --> 00:05:59.230
it's to see you.

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.000
He wants me back again.

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:06.800
I must go welcome him.

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:10.120
Are you leaving?

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:13.350
Wait for my word.

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:15.460
Then I'll wait till you're done.

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:16.360
Wait for my word.

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:18.000
I have something for you.

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:20.320
You're leaving too?

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:23.080
I've found my mother.

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:24.640
I will depart at once.

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:26.150
I won't trouble you any longer.

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:27.800
Finding family is a blessing.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.160
Then I won't keep you here.

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:30.190
Take care on your way.

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:32.040
You're a good man.

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:34.680
I'll never forget your kindness.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.430
You are always welcome back.

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:38.490
Come back whenever you miss us.

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:39.440
Sure.

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:46.660
Wang.

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:51.510
I've secured the materials
for the mausoleum.

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:52.490
We can start anytime.

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:54.270
Begin first thing tomorrow.

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:55.800
Make sure nothing goes wrong.

00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:56.850
Rest assured, milord.

00:06:57.130 --> 00:06:59.030
I'd brave blades and flames
without hesitation.

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:00.960
Not to mention the generous money.

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:04.200
I trust your work.

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:05.350
Go on, then.

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:06.400
Alright.

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:19.870
I do feel refreshed today.

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:21.920
I told you so.

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:23.360
You'll surely live a long life.

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:24.680
Truly?

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:25.520
Absolutely.

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:30.270
But you should brush your teeth
more often.

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:32.110
Look.

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:34.360
Brush often, and keep your teeth strong.

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:36.130
Eat well, and keep your appetite up.

00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:38.090
That way, you'll stay full of energy.

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:41.160
Only then can you stay in good health

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:42.480
and live a long, full life.

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:44.360
Right?

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:45.200
Foam.

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:47.370
Foam?

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:48.680
Yeah, Foam.

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:50.390
Everyone's worked hard.

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:52.280
Let's warm up by the fire.

00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:54.760
- Rest before we move on.
- Sure.

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:56.910
- Are you cold?
- Yeah.

00:07:56.910 --> 00:07:58.260
How about you? Feeling warmer now?

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:02.190
With the fire going, it's much warmer.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:09.840
Hey, what's this?

00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:11.120
Ah, my head.

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:11.960
My head.

00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:13.790
My head!

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:15.440
My head hurts so much.

00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:49.750
Please, Marquis.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.120
"Bewitching Incense is Poisonous"
has spread across the city.

00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:54.270
Every commoner now knows

00:08:54.270 --> 00:08:55.600
the harm of Mishenfu.

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:59.000
Those wicked ones
have no chance to act now.

00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:00.790
Driving out the poison
is the first step.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.380
Next, we must see to it
that the people here

00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:05.030
can live better lives.

00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:07.680
What wise plan do you have?

00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:10.260
I'm at your service.

00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:12.120
Heng has had a plan prepared.

00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:14.310
What we need to do next is

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:16.050
to set the officials in order.

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:17.160
Good.

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:18.940
(Yamen of Swan County)

00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:22.440
Bring the prisoners before me.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.480
Milord! Milord!

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:30.760
In days past,

00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:33.150
you all suffered at the hands
of corrupt officials,

00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:34.790
the bullying of rural tyrants,

00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:37.450
and so many injustices.

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:38.720
Those criminals

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:39.660
won't get away.

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:43.400
Today is the day to punish
those who trample the people

00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:45.630
and twist the law for selfish gain.

00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:48.000
Good.

00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:50.620
Turn around and see for yourselves.

00:09:51.310 --> 00:10:00.330
Corrupt official!

00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:05.000
As the officials, you exploited
your posts for personal gain,

00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:07.390
instead of easing the people's burdens.

00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:11.120
You even used the Marquis's name
to crush the people

00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:15.270
and impose the absurd breathing tax.

00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:16.790
This is utterly preposterous.

00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:18.920
A crime beyond measure!

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:20.710
You must be punished without mercy.

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:22.760
Yes, yes.

00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:28.090
Bribing officials of the court

00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:29.320
and corrupting law and order

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:31.030
must be dealt with even more severely.

00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:33.290
Luo Xin

00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:34.870
embezzled state funds,

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:35.930
enslaved the commoners,

00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:37.150
and used torture excessively.

00:10:37.150 --> 00:10:38.320
His crimes are beyond pardon.

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:39.720
Hu Kuan is treacherous.

00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:40.870
He altered case records,

00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:42.030
assaulted the innocent,

00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:43.270
and framed others.

00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:45.080
Their crimes are boundless.

00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:46.480
By law, they should be executed.

00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:48.360
- Good!
- Milord!

00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:50.730
Behead them!

00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:52.610
The remaining accomplices

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:54.600
shall be judged for their crimes.

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:57.030
They shall redeem,
be fined, or serve labor

00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:59.120
to show the might of the law,

00:10:59.390 --> 00:11:00.440
calm the people,

00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:01.600
and quell public anger.

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:04.000
Good!

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:04.910
Guards!

00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:06.880
Drag these two out.

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:08.580
Behead them at once.

00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:10.810
- Thanks, milord.
- Please spare us.

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:12.120
Thank you, milord.

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:13.900
Spare my life, milord.

00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:15.400
You should've been beheaded long ago.

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:16.870
- Milord.
- Corrupt official!

00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:18.650
- With the Marquis
- Corrupt official!

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:21.320
and me here,

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:24.080
Haihun shall know peace,

00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:26.910
and the people shall live in harmony.

00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:28.830
Thanks to Marquis.

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:31.000
Thanks to Lord Sun.

00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:34.830
Good, good.

00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:37.300
- So much gold.
- Gold!

00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:38.200
Indeed.

00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:39.210
This is real.

00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:40.100
It's gold.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:41.860
So much gold.

00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:42.800
- Really?
- Let me try.

00:11:43.510 --> 00:11:44.720
It's true.

00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:47.630
You'll get your usual wages

00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:50.720
and extra compensation from me.

00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:54.640
Thank you, Marquis.

00:11:55.410 --> 00:11:57.480
Today marks the day we resume work

00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:01.080
and the beginning
of the 8-hour work system.

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:02.840
What's that?

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:04.390
The 8-hour work system

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:09.030
means you work only 8 hours a day.

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:10.910
8 hours?

00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:12.640
Wonderful!

00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:13.870
So many gold biscuits.

00:12:14.850 --> 00:12:15.690
Yeah. This...

00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:19.350
Take a look.

00:12:20.810 --> 00:12:21.700
Please take a look.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:22.840
Sir.

00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:24.170
Where's my arc-shaped jade?

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:25.050
Sir.

00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:26.300
The arc-shaped jade is ready.

00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:30.630
Light.

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:33.330
This is fine jade indeed.

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:38.370
- De Jiu.
- Sachets for sale!

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.020
Sir, this sachet.

00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:42.080
Things have come to an end.

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:43.970
All the strange cases
in Yuzhang are resolved.

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:45.600
Only that Xiqiang assassin still...

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:46.440
Today,

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:48.840
can we not talk about work?

00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:50.560
Work?

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:52.440
Duties.

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:55.200
What should we talk about?

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:56.370
Trinkets!

00:12:57.910 --> 00:12:59.480
Can't we talk about something

00:12:59.910 --> 00:13:01.030
between you and me?

00:13:03.930 --> 00:13:04.790
Right.

00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:05.550
I almost forgot.

00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:07.280
I haven't taught you
the Breath Technique.

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:08.520
That's not important.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.120
Just come with me.

00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:19.700
Sachets for sale!

00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:21.320
Sir, this sachet.

00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:24.390
Common Joy Market.

00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:27.180
As the name says,
it's a paradise to share joy with all.

00:13:27.550 --> 00:13:28.750
It opens every two days,

00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:30.790
providing food, drinks, and games.

00:13:31.250 --> 00:13:33.330
When it's open, the curfew is lifted.

00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:37.200
Couriers serve food lovers all day long.

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:39.910
They race to deliver the feast
as fast as possible.

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:41.960
They all share one name:

00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:42.800
Delivered Yet.

00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:45.090
Since you can have food delivered,

00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:46.200
why bring me here?

00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:49.910
Because wok hei can't be delivered.

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:51.320
What is wok hei?

00:13:52.510 --> 00:13:53.350
Over there.

00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:54.630
Why not have a try?

00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:57.890
Ladies and gentlemen,
come and try our lamb skewers!

00:13:58.090 --> 00:13:58.930
Lamb skewers!

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:00.540
They have lamb skewers.

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:04.440
Sir.

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:05.840
- 10 lamb skewers.
- Got it.

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:06.750
Me too!

00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:07.590
Careful.

00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:08.850
Slow down, slow down!

00:14:08.850 --> 00:14:10.070
- Two for me.
- One for me.

00:14:10.070 --> 00:14:11.620
- Everyone will get some.
- I want ten.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.130
- Three.
- How many for you?

00:14:13.130 --> 00:14:14.400
- Me too!
- Sure.

00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:15.540
- Come on.
- Mine.

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:24.690
Slow down, slow down!

00:14:25.390 --> 00:14:26.330
What's wrong with you?

00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:28.400
Sir, ten for me.

00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:29.630
It's nothing.

00:14:29.630 --> 00:14:30.470
Ten for me.

00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:32.080
Give me this batch.

00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:33.390
It's a bit hot.

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:36.200
Thanks.

00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:38.000
Smells amazing.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.300
I'm not a fan of waiting in line.

00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:40.580
I'll have a skewer too.

00:14:43.830 --> 00:14:44.760
Sir, where's mine?

00:15:10.630 --> 00:15:11.860
How about a wager?

00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:14.390
What's the bet?

00:15:14.910 --> 00:15:15.990
Truth or Dare.

00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:18.080
I know the Truth.

00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:19.270
And what's a Dare?

00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:20.820
Try it and you'll see.

00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:25.870
How do we play?

00:15:27.550 --> 00:15:28.790
Best two out of three.

00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:37.080
I won.

00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:42.000
Then you choose.

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:43.270
Dare.

00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:46.200
Can I pick Truth instead?

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:48.840
Forget it then.

00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:50.000
You owe me for now.

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:51.790
No.

00:15:52.270 --> 00:15:53.550
I don't like owing anyone.

00:15:53.630 --> 00:15:55.000
You've owed me enough.

00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:56.870
I truly mean every word.

00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:58.020
When you men speak,

00:15:58.020 --> 00:15:59.260
there's hardly a word of truth.

00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:00.550
It doesn't look like me at all.

00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:02.080
Stop looking. Come on, let's go.

00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:05.400
The battle between Chi You
and Haihun Marquis.

00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:07.220
The great battle!

00:16:07.230 --> 00:16:08.830
- Does the Marquis know?
- Take a look.

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:11.420
- He wrote this.
- The great battle!

00:16:11.510 --> 00:16:13.260
- Time-travel with tourism.
- Take a look.

00:16:13.270 --> 00:16:14.360
It's bound to make money.

00:16:14.370 --> 00:16:16.230
The battle between Chi You
and Haihun Marquis!

00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:18.240
A touch of red on the branch.

00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:19.810
A few wishes on the cloth.

00:16:20.050 --> 00:16:21.030
Since we're already here,

00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:21.960
why not make a wish?

00:16:22.630 --> 00:16:23.470
I don't believe it.

00:16:23.470 --> 00:16:25.030
Everyone, have a look.

00:16:25.190 --> 00:16:27.340
The battle between Chi You
and Haihun Marquis!

00:16:29.790 --> 00:16:32.030
Heroine, give us a little support.

00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:33.120
Come on, come on.

00:16:33.550 --> 00:16:34.390
Just once.

00:16:56.630 --> 00:16:57.720
You finished so soon?

00:16:58.870 --> 00:16:59.710
Yeah.

00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:02.630
Hurry, hang it up.

00:17:02.630 --> 00:17:03.470
Here.

00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:23.000
(May I soon pacify Xiqiang)

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:24.180
(and fulfill Master's wish.)

00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:25.110
(Then)

00:17:25.610 --> 00:17:27.180
(I can stay by your side.)

00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:30.720
Done.

00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:34.830
What wish did you make?

00:17:35.030 --> 00:17:35.870
So secretive.

00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:38.790
If I tell you, it won't come true.

00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:39.720
So, I can't say.

00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:52.590
I've decided on my dare.

00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:55.640
What is it?

00:17:57.510 --> 00:17:59.440
You must not tell the truth right now.

00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:09.790
Lord Wang.

00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:11.030
Lady De Jiu.

00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:12.960
May I have a word in private?

00:18:21.110 --> 00:18:22.000
Colonel.

00:18:22.030 --> 00:18:23.720
His Majesty has arrived in Yuzhang.

00:18:23.730 --> 00:18:25.190
You are ordered to welcome him.

00:18:25.430 --> 00:18:26.790
Understood. I'll go at once.

00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:30.190
De Jiu.

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:35.160
I left you a message.

00:18:36.050 --> 00:18:37.670
You'll know it
once you leave the city.

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:44.110
Stay safe.

00:18:55.740 --> 00:18:59.780
(I miss you dearly here in Yuzhang.)
