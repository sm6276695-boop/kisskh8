"Cool it with a baboon's blood."

"By the pricking of my thumbs,

00:00:23.231 --> 00:00:25.734
something wicked this way comes."

[somber music playing]

00:00:34.868 --> 00:00:36.202
How's our little cadaver?

00:00:36.786 --> 00:00:38.954
[Morticia] The doctor suggested
I read to her.

00:00:38.955 --> 00:00:40.330
I chose Macbeth.

00:00:40.331 --> 00:00:42.750
Nothing like death, despair,
and dismemberment

00:00:42.751 --> 00:00:45.003
to try and snap her out of her coma.

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:47.046
[Gomez] Tish, come on.

00:00:47.047 --> 00:00:50.258
Denmark will still be rotten tomorrow.

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:53.678
Wrong tragedy, mon chéri.

00:00:57.348 --> 00:00:58.266
[Gomez] Come on.

Rise and shine, sleepy head.

00:01:17.494 --> 00:01:18.660
Principal Weems?

00:01:18.661 --> 00:01:20.454
Ready for your sponge bath?

00:01:20.455 --> 00:01:22.456
What ring of Hell is this?

00:01:22.457 --> 00:01:23.541

[Weems whispering] Miss Addams...

00:01:45.522 --> 00:01:46.940
This isn't Hell.

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:50.317
But I understand the confusion.

00:01:50.318 --> 00:01:52.820
If I'm not dead, then why are you here?

00:01:52.821 --> 00:01:55.072
Because I am your new spirit guide.

00:01:55.073 --> 00:01:56.406
Surprise!

00:01:56.407 --> 00:01:59.660
That's impossible.
A spirit guide must be a relative.

00:01:59.661 --> 00:02:01.954
Turns out we're 13th cousins.

00:02:01.955 --> 00:02:03.581
Twice removed.

00:02:04.165 --> 00:02:06.042
There has to be another option.

00:02:06.626 --> 00:02:09.796
Your last spirit guide
literally gave up her ghost to save you.

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.674
Believe me, nobody was putting up
their hand for this assignment.

00:02:13.675 --> 00:02:14.800
Yet here you are.

00:02:14.801 --> 00:02:18.137
The tantalizing prospect
of tormenting you from beyond the grave

00:02:18.138 --> 00:02:20.389
was just too delicious to pass up.

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.809
Now, you've certainly been a busy bee.

00:02:24.435 --> 00:02:25.687
Just a recap...

00:02:26.396 --> 00:02:27.980
You lost your psychic ability.

00:02:27.981 --> 00:02:29.356
Only after I mastered it.

00:02:29.357 --> 00:02:33.819
You lied to your one and only friend,
Enid Sinclair, about her impending doom.

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.237
I was protecting her.

00:02:35.238 --> 00:02:37.364
And the coup de grâce,

00:02:37.365 --> 00:02:40.492
freeing Tyler Galpin, a homicidal Hyde,

00:02:40.493 --> 00:02:44.121
from a high-security
psychiatric institution.

00:02:44.122 --> 00:02:46.915
Congratulations, Miss Addams.

00:02:46.916 --> 00:02:51.044
Your hubris has yet again made you
the architect of your own demise.

00:02:51.045 --> 00:02:53.547
I didn't think death
could make you any more condescending.

00:02:53.548 --> 00:02:56.550
And your arrogance
has only made you more insufferable.

00:02:56.551 --> 00:03:00.013
Why don't you restore my ability,
so we can go our separate ways?

00:03:02.098 --> 00:03:03.724
Your ability

00:03:03.725 --> 00:03:06.476
is inextricably tied to who you are.

00:03:06.477 --> 00:03:08.020
You abused it.

00:03:08.021 --> 00:03:09.563
You sound like my mother.

00:03:09.564 --> 00:03:11.273
Sticks and stones.

00:03:11.274 --> 00:03:12.525
Except,

00:03:13.151 --> 00:03:14.651
I have no bones.

00:03:14.652 --> 00:03:16.321
I'm done being lectured.

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:19.364
Then wake up!

00:03:19.365 --> 00:03:20.449

[music trails off]

00:04:25.515 --> 00:04:29.143
Good afternoon. I'm Judi Stonehurst,
interim director of Willow Hill.

00:04:30.186 --> 00:04:34.147
Two weeks ago, our facility
suffered a catastrophic power failure.

00:04:34.148 --> 00:04:37.443
As a result, 46 of our residents escaped.

00:04:38.027 --> 00:04:40.404
Sadly, there were several deaths,

00:04:40.405 --> 00:04:43.907
including our beloved director,
Dr. Rachael Fairburn.

00:04:43.908 --> 00:04:46.785
But, with the heroic help
of the sheriff's department,

00:04:46.786 --> 00:04:49.454
we have apprehended 43 of those fugitives.

00:04:49.455 --> 00:04:52.624
[voice quavering]
They'll be reassigned to other facilities,

00:04:52.625 --> 00:04:54.460
since Willow Hill is

00:04:55.253 --> 00:04:57.296
closed for the foreseeable future.

00:04:57.297 --> 00:04:58.381
Thank you.

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:02.092
- [reporters clamoring]
- [reporter] Sheriff Santiago!

00:05:02.093 --> 00:05:04.886
The three fugitives still at large

00:05:04.887 --> 00:05:06.638
are Fester Addams,

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:08.682
a patient known as "John Doe,"

00:05:08.683 --> 00:05:10.517
and Tyler Galpin.

00:05:10.518 --> 00:05:14.688
I need to reiterate that they are
considered extremely dangerous.

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:16.398
If you see any of them,

00:05:16.399 --> 00:05:18.859
contact the sheriff's department
immediately.

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.110
Yes.

00:05:20.111 --> 00:05:22.237
Do you think they're still in the area?

00:05:22.238 --> 00:05:24.531
We believe Fester Addams is long gone.

00:05:24.532 --> 00:05:26.325
It's hard to say with John Doe.

00:05:26.326 --> 00:05:30.370
We do know that Tyler suffered
multiple gunshot wounds.

00:05:30.371 --> 00:05:31.538
[reporters clamoring]

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:33.624
- No more questions at this time.
- [phone chimes]

00:05:37.045 --> 00:05:39.963
Ms. Stonehurst,
Wednesday Addams just woke up.

00:05:39.964 --> 00:05:42.508
I'm curious to hear
about her part in all of this.

00:05:43.176 --> 00:05:47.054
As I told you, Sheriff, it was
a simple case of wrong place, wrong time.

00:05:47.055 --> 00:05:50.098
She snuck in to pay
her uncle an unauthorized visit.

00:05:50.099 --> 00:05:52.101
Sure she wasn't trying to free him?

00:05:52.685 --> 00:05:54.936
It's hardly credible
that an ordinary teenage girl

00:05:54.937 --> 00:05:57.982
could be capable of circumventing
Willow Hill security.

00:05:58.566 --> 00:06:01.152
"Ordinary" is the last word I'd use
to describe Wednesday Addams.

00:06:01.861 --> 00:06:02.862
Hmm.

00:06:04.072 --> 00:06:07.366
Well, if you'll excuse me,
an interim director's work is never done.

00:06:07.367 --> 00:06:09.160
[chuckling]

00:06:18.503 --> 00:06:19.504
[phone ringing]

00:06:23.174 --> 00:06:24.175
[line trilling]

00:06:32.809 --> 00:06:36.229
[man] I've eliminated all the escapees
from the LOIS lab, except one.

00:06:36.813 --> 00:06:38.188
Patient 1938.

00:06:38.189 --> 00:06:40.941
By the looks of her,
this one ain't gonna put up a fight.

00:06:40.942 --> 00:06:44.611
[Stonehurst] The sheriff's still blind
about LOIS and I want to keep it that way.

00:06:44.612 --> 00:06:48.657
Now, I emptied out
my rainy day fund hiring you,

00:06:48.658 --> 00:06:51.619
so do your job and find her.

00:06:57.625 --> 00:06:59.001
[footsteps approaching]

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:04.132
Leaving so soon?

00:07:06.342 --> 00:07:07.802
I brought you some lilies.

00:07:08.469 --> 00:07:09.761
Mmm.

00:07:09.762 --> 00:07:11.888
It's a sign of renewal and fresh starts.

00:07:11.889 --> 00:07:15.684
The sheriff will be getting an anonymous
tip to check out your secret lab.

00:07:15.685 --> 00:07:18.562
I'm afraid all she'll find
are boxes of dusty files.

00:07:18.563 --> 00:07:22.692
My secrets are dead and buried
in places no one will ever find them.

00:07:23.276 --> 00:07:26.027
- If you've come to gloat--
- Who's gloating?

00:07:26.028 --> 00:07:28.405
You destroyed my father's life's work.

00:07:28.406 --> 00:07:31.950
I'm here to make sure that
you don't scorch the earth any further.

00:07:31.951 --> 00:07:33.995
Scorched earth is just a warm-up.

00:07:34.495 --> 00:07:36.037
I aim for total incineration.

00:07:36.038 --> 00:07:40.417
I would keep that trigger finger
off your flamethrower, missy.

00:07:40.418 --> 00:07:42.294
Unless you'd like me
to tell Sheriff Santiago

00:07:42.295 --> 00:07:44.922
how you illegally broke into Willow Hill.

00:07:45.423 --> 00:07:46.799
Who's patient 1938?

00:07:48.092 --> 00:07:50.177
Why didn't she get a fake obituary?

00:07:50.178 --> 00:07:52.304
What makes her so special?

00:07:52.305 --> 00:07:54.474
I don't know who you're talking about.

00:07:55.808 --> 00:07:58.060
Seems like all your secrets
aren't dead and buried.

00:08:00.521 --> 00:08:02.190
[candy striper] Wednesday Addams?

00:08:02.773 --> 00:08:04.733
Never delivered dead flowers before.

[ominous music playing]

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:09.155
Who gave you this?

[horrifying music trilling]

00:08:15.703 --> 00:08:17.246
[suspenseful music building]

00:08:27.965 --> 00:08:30.258
[woman] Buenos días, sickly children.

00:08:30.259 --> 00:08:32.844
We are here spreading Day of the Dead joy.

00:08:32.845 --> 00:08:36.182
It's you! I recognize
that fudge-curdling glare.

00:08:36.891 --> 00:08:38.351
A pox on thee!

00:08:40.603 --> 00:08:45.149
Direct from Pilgrim World,
meet our Mayflower Mariachis.

00:08:46.192 --> 00:08:48.236
[pensive, mysterious music playing]

00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:52.822
[Bianca] Don't worry, Mom.
Nobody's going to find you here.

00:08:52.823 --> 00:08:56.202
After the fire last semester,
this part of the school is off-limits.

00:08:56.786 --> 00:09:00.163
As long as you're here, you'll be safe
from Gideon and Morning Song.

00:09:00.164 --> 00:09:01.123
[relieved sigh]

00:09:04.794 --> 00:09:06.671
So I Googled this Gideon guy.

00:09:07.213 --> 00:09:10.549
Someone reported seeing him
at a motel in Boston last week.

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:13.051
- He's getting closer.
- Please don't tell my mom.

00:09:13.052 --> 00:09:14.804
It'll freak her out even more.

00:09:15.429 --> 00:09:17.847
Oh, man. I still can't believe
you guys are involved

00:09:17.848 --> 00:09:20.059
in this whole Morning Song scandal.

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:22.852
My mother was one of its first members.

00:09:22.853 --> 00:09:25.522
Gideon used her siren song
to recruit people.

00:09:25.523 --> 00:09:27.524
She told me that when it started,

00:09:27.525 --> 00:09:29.819
they were actually
trying to help Outcasts.

00:09:30.319 --> 00:09:31.861
It was a real community.

00:09:31.862 --> 00:09:33.155
So what changed?

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:36.367
Cults often set out with good intentions.

00:09:37.535 --> 00:09:40.078
Growing up, Gideon was my hero.

00:09:40.079 --> 00:09:44.040
Of all the kids, I was his favorite.

00:09:44.041 --> 00:09:45.542
But then his mask slipped,

00:09:45.543 --> 00:09:48.671
and I realized he was grooming me
to take over for my mom.

00:09:49.672 --> 00:09:51.716
Everything spiraled so quickly.

00:09:53.175 --> 00:09:56.429
Look, as long as no one knows
your mom's at Nevermore,

00:09:58.097 --> 00:10:00.391
Gideon can't touch her or you.

00:10:22.622 --> 00:10:25.875
Wednesday! I didn't think
you were gonna be back for days.

00:10:26.459 --> 00:10:27.584
What are you doing here?

00:10:27.585 --> 00:10:30.045
I've come to observe you
in your natural habitat.

00:10:30.046 --> 00:10:32.339
[cheeky, eccentric music playing]

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:33.549
[Enid] Uh...

00:10:34.467 --> 00:10:35.967
I live here, remember?

00:10:35.968 --> 00:10:37.802
You're probably still sore
from your injuries.

00:10:37.803 --> 00:10:40.096
Pain reminds me that I'm still alive.

00:10:40.097 --> 00:10:43.266
Your mom said you were
staying at the cottage to recuperate.

00:10:43.267 --> 00:10:46.062
There's no time for that.
Tyler's still out there.

00:10:46.646 --> 00:10:50.565
Sheriff Santiago said he's either dead
from the gunshot wounds or long gone.

00:10:50.566 --> 00:10:51.734
He's alive.

00:10:52.234 --> 00:10:53.234
He's in Jericho.

00:10:53.235 --> 00:10:54.694
You saw him?

00:10:54.695 --> 00:10:56.571
I need you to pack up and go home.

00:10:56.572 --> 00:10:58.573
Leave? Why?

00:10:58.574 --> 00:11:01.994
He has plans to kill both of us.
I'm going to fix it.

00:11:02.578 --> 00:11:04.746
Fix it? You're the reason he escaped.

00:11:04.747 --> 00:11:06.123
She's got a point.

00:11:06.707 --> 00:11:08.917
I'm not scared of Tyler.
I already took him down once.

00:11:08.918 --> 00:11:12.379
There's not a full moon for another week.
You got lucky last time.

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:15.590
What do you mean lucky?
I still have the scars from that fight.

00:11:15.591 --> 00:11:17.050
Tyler had you pinned against a tree

00:11:17.051 --> 00:11:19.636
and was going to rip your throat out
until Galpin shot him.

00:11:19.637 --> 00:11:21.179
I read the police statement.

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:24.182
Then I guess it was lucky
I showed up and saved your life.

00:11:24.183 --> 00:11:26.142
Tyler was going to gut you as well.

00:11:26.143 --> 00:11:28.186
[Weems] She's got you there too.

00:11:28.187 --> 00:11:31.064
- Tell her the truth about the premonition.
- Stay out of this.

00:11:31.065 --> 00:11:33.024
Who are you talking to?

00:11:33.025 --> 00:11:34.026
No one.

00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:37.070
Okay, I'm going to blame
this conversation on your head trauma.

00:11:37.071 --> 00:11:38.530
Enid, I'm trying to save you.

00:11:38.531 --> 00:11:40.490
I don't need you to save me.

00:11:40.491 --> 00:11:43.494
Is that why you stuck me
on lookout duty at Willow Hill?

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:45.746
Do you think I'm that helpless?

00:11:47.498 --> 00:11:49.750
[scoffs softly] Your silence is deafening.

00:11:51.168 --> 00:11:53.170
- Where are you going?
- To be with my pack.

00:11:53.671 --> 00:11:55.672
You might think
you're the only capable one here,

00:11:55.673 --> 00:11:57.298
but you can't do everything on your own.

00:11:57.299 --> 00:12:00.219
That's not how the world works,
even for Wednesday Addams.

00:12:03.681 --> 00:12:05.391
[Weems] Miss Sinclair for the win.

00:12:06.434 --> 00:12:08.686
Stay out of my room and my head.

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:17.026
[Wednesday] Tyler declared
that Enid and I will die today.

00:12:17.027 --> 00:12:20.488
He may be a deranged psychopath,
but his timing is poetic.

00:12:20.489 --> 00:12:22.449
If I could choose my last day,

00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:25.578
El Día de los Muertos
would top my wish list.

00:12:26.495 --> 00:12:29.330
The Day of the Dead has
always been my favorite holiday.

00:12:29.331 --> 00:12:31.458
Macabre decor, graveyard gatherings,

00:12:31.459 --> 00:12:33.960
and the chance to commune
with dead relatives.

00:12:33.961 --> 00:12:35.296
What's not to like?

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:37.255
Unfortunately, this year

00:12:37.256 --> 00:12:40.550
an unwelcome ghost
from my past has turned up uninvited.

00:12:40.551 --> 00:12:44.262
I was curious to see
where the Weems memorial was placed.

00:12:44.263 --> 00:12:46.931
I did sacrifice my life
for the school, after all.

00:12:46.932 --> 00:12:50.603
I preferred Goody's cryptic pronouncements
to your spectral stalking.

00:12:51.228 --> 00:12:53.938
I wasn't expecting anything ostentatious.

00:12:53.939 --> 00:12:59.068
My portrait joining those on the wall
of illustrious past principals.

00:12:59.069 --> 00:13:00.445
Perhaps a bronze bust,

00:13:00.446 --> 00:13:04.657
maybe even a small
memorial shrine with candles.

00:13:04.658 --> 00:13:06.367
Even a cuddly toy or two.

00:13:06.368 --> 00:13:09.496
If you're not gonna give me
my psychic ability back, you're dismissed.

00:13:09.497 --> 00:13:11.080
I'm not a genie.

00:13:11.081 --> 00:13:12.416
I don't grant wishes.

00:13:13.167 --> 00:13:16.252
If you want your ability back, that starts
with an honest self-assessment.

00:13:16.253 --> 00:13:17.797
[students whooping]

00:13:19.048 --> 00:13:20.882
Nice catch, Mr. Ottinger!

00:13:20.883 --> 00:13:22.051
Who's next?

00:13:24.804 --> 00:13:27.139
- Who on Earth is that?
- Principal Dort.

00:13:27.723 --> 00:13:29.516
[Weems] Dort? Never heard of him.

00:13:29.517 --> 00:13:32.811
And he certainly wasn't on my list
of pre-approved successors.

00:13:32.812 --> 00:13:35.272
Happy Día de los Muertos!

00:13:38.192 --> 00:13:40.402
Anything for a t-shirt, am I right?

00:13:41.278 --> 00:13:42.613
All right.

00:13:43.155 --> 00:13:46.617
This is also
our Outcast Day of Remembrance.

00:13:47.451 --> 00:13:48.827
Following annual tradition,

00:13:48.828 --> 00:13:52.872
at midnight the remembrance procession
will head to the Nevermore cemetery,

00:13:52.873 --> 00:13:57.253
and pay our respects
to all those who have gone before us.

00:13:58.045 --> 00:13:59.046
Don't worry,

00:13:59.755 --> 00:14:02.925
it won't be a complete downer
because there will also be food trucks!

00:14:03.425 --> 00:14:04.884
[students cheering]

00:14:04.885 --> 00:14:06.095
Food trucks!

00:14:08.514 --> 00:14:09.806
Yeah! [laughs]

00:14:09.807 --> 00:14:13.227
He's a carnival barker
masquerading as an educator.

00:14:15.104 --> 00:14:16.479
[Wednesday] Principal Dort.

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:21.025
Wednesday. It is good to see you back
among the living on this Day of the Dead.

00:14:21.026 --> 00:14:22.610
The day is young.

00:14:22.611 --> 00:14:25.280
If there's anything I can do
to help your recovery...

00:14:25.281 --> 00:14:27.073
Cancel tonight's festivities.

00:14:27.074 --> 00:14:28.367
Tyler's still out there.

00:14:28.951 --> 00:14:31.369
According to Sheriff Santiago,
he fled town.

00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:33.997
He hasn't. His threat is real.

00:14:33.998 --> 00:14:37.166
I appreciate your concern,
and your trauma,

00:14:37.167 --> 00:14:39.003
but we aren't canceling tonight.

00:14:39.587 --> 00:14:41.170
I've invited several prominent donors,

00:14:41.171 --> 00:14:44.215
and they will be here
to see our community in action.

00:14:44.216 --> 00:14:47.261
The only thing they'll see is
a Hyde ripping them limb from limb.

00:14:48.012 --> 00:14:51.139
In the remote off-chance
Tyler Galpin breaches our wall,

00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:54.851
we have a school full of Outcasts
ready to take him on.

00:14:54.852 --> 00:14:56.854
Especially Professor Capri.

00:14:58.063 --> 00:15:00.023
What does she know about taking on a Hyde?

00:15:00.024 --> 00:15:01.650
She has a history with them.

00:15:02.401 --> 00:15:04.695
You aren't alone in this anymore,
Wednesday.

00:15:05.696 --> 00:15:07.156
One more question.

00:15:07.656 --> 00:15:10.075
How do you plan on honoring
the late Principal Weems tonight?

00:15:10.826 --> 00:15:12.076
[Dort] Honor?

00:15:12.077 --> 00:15:15.079
I've spent months trying to expunge
that woman's memory

00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:17.415
from every student and every donor's mind.

00:15:17.416 --> 00:15:20.544
She lingers like the smell of rancid Brie.

00:15:21.462 --> 00:15:22.712
[Dort] Blech.

00:15:22.713 --> 00:15:26.132
After everything I've done
to burnish this school's reputation...

00:15:26.133 --> 00:15:27.759
There's your honest assessment.

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:29.845
[sardonic, eccentric music playing]

00:15:30.763 --> 00:15:31.680
[music trails off]

00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:36.060
[creature chirring, growling]

00:15:37.853 --> 00:15:39.480
There you are, mijo.

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:44.108
I realize your mother and I
have been so focused on your sister,

00:15:44.109 --> 00:15:45.778
we haven't been around for you.

00:15:46.987 --> 00:15:48.364
It's not just that.

00:15:48.948 --> 00:15:50.114
[pensive music playing]

00:15:50.115 --> 00:15:51.533
I'm worried about Slurp.

00:15:52.034 --> 00:15:55.579
I know he's done some bad things,
but it's not his fault he's hungry.

00:15:56.246 --> 00:15:57.706
[flytrap gurgling]

00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:01.543
Losing your first pet can be hard.

00:16:02.795 --> 00:16:06.673
Your Uncle Fester had a chupacabra
when he was about your age.

00:16:06.674 --> 00:16:09.509
No matter how much
of his blood he gave it to drink,

00:16:09.510 --> 00:16:11.011
it wasn't meant to be a pet.

00:16:11.845 --> 00:16:13.930
I raised Slurp from the dead.

00:16:13.931 --> 00:16:15.723
He's my responsibility.

00:16:15.724 --> 00:16:16.809
And...

00:16:18.394 --> 00:16:21.313
I know if they find him,
they'll put him down for good.

00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:27.444
What about this? What about
if I help you track your zombie?

00:16:28.445 --> 00:16:30.321
We'll make it a father-son adventure.

00:16:30.322 --> 00:16:32.449
- Hmm?
- Yeah.

00:16:33.033 --> 00:16:34.034
Yeah.

00:16:35.285 --> 00:16:36.870
[bird cawing]

00:16:44.545 --> 00:16:46.547
[taut, suspenseful music playing]

00:16:48.298 --> 00:16:49.299
[branches snapping]

00:17:05.441 --> 00:17:07.818
[Galpin] This is
what your life has come to?

00:17:09.903 --> 00:17:12.031
Cowering in a sewer, all alone.

00:17:13.073 --> 00:17:14.700
You're not real.

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:17.618
Thank God your mother
can't see you right now.

00:17:17.619 --> 00:17:20.204
Think of all the hopes
and dreams she had for you.

00:17:20.205 --> 00:17:21.957
Her only child.

00:17:22.708 --> 00:17:24.334
Her beloved son.

00:17:26.003 --> 00:17:27.378
She'd be so disappointed.

00:17:27.379 --> 00:17:29.465
You don't get to talk about her!

00:17:30.049 --> 00:17:31.800
She deserved better than you.

00:17:32.301 --> 00:17:35.012
Yeah, on that we are in agreement.

00:17:35.596 --> 00:17:38.057
You always looked at me with fear.

00:17:38.724 --> 00:17:40.476
You knew this would happen.

00:17:44.146 --> 00:17:45.938
I tried to protect you.

00:17:45.939 --> 00:17:48.358
By crawling into a bottle and ignoring me?

00:17:52.071 --> 00:17:53.405
You're in a real jam.

00:17:54.698 --> 00:17:56.241
You killed your master.

00:17:58.118 --> 00:17:59.536
That's a bold move, son.

00:18:01.538 --> 00:18:02.914
I didn't need her.

00:18:02.915 --> 00:18:04.708
I don't need anyone.

00:18:05.667 --> 00:18:06.959
Turn yourself in.

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:08.503
Leave me alone!

00:18:08.504 --> 00:18:10.505
That's the only way out alive.

00:18:10.506 --> 00:18:14.426
Leave me alone!
Leave me alone! Leave me alone!

00:18:48.418 --> 00:18:49.503
[jarring stinger]

00:19:13.569 --> 00:19:15.863
- [Tyler snarling]
- [man screaming]

00:19:17.531 --> 00:19:18.865
[flesh rending]

00:19:18.866 --> 00:19:20.951
[eerie, distressing music playing]

00:19:23.829 --> 00:19:27.124
[breathing heavily]

00:19:32.963 --> 00:19:34.339
[Capri] Wednesday.

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:36.048
Good to see you on your feet.

00:19:36.049 --> 00:19:38.926
Not many people can say
they survived a Hyde attack.

00:19:38.927 --> 00:19:42.138
Well, you're one of them.
Principal Dort told me.

00:19:42.139 --> 00:19:44.641
Alfie Penn. Name ring a bell?

00:19:45.475 --> 00:19:48.770
Seems your ex-boyfriend
was shot dead after attacking you.

00:19:49.438 --> 00:19:52.023
How dare you snoop in my desk?

00:19:52.024 --> 00:19:54.233
You met Alfie
at an artist colony in Woodstock.

00:19:54.234 --> 00:19:57.528
He was at the forefront of something
titled "violent expressionism,"

00:19:57.529 --> 00:19:59.448
otherwise known as "splatter art."

00:20:00.073 --> 00:20:02.201
Until his life began to imitate his work.

00:20:03.368 --> 00:20:05.162
What drove him to try and kill you?

00:20:07.915 --> 00:20:09.333
Tyler Galpin is coming.

00:20:09.958 --> 00:20:11.960
I need to learn
everything I can about Hydes.

00:20:19.176 --> 00:20:21.678
I never knew Alfie's true nature.

00:20:22.387 --> 00:20:25.390
Only that we were happy together.

00:20:26.767 --> 00:20:28.477
You fell in love with a monster.

00:20:30.103 --> 00:20:32.021
His master was in love with him too.

00:20:32.022 --> 00:20:34.775
She ordered him to kill me.

00:20:35.359 --> 00:20:38.319
Luckily it was a full moon
so I was able to fight him off.

00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:41.447
But Alfie accidentally
killed her in the process.

00:20:41.448 --> 00:20:42.783
It was horrible.

00:20:43.575 --> 00:20:45.993
I heard a Hyde
can't survive without a master.

00:20:45.994 --> 00:20:48.371
Males can't. They go crazy without one.

00:20:48.372 --> 00:20:51.999
Psychosis, paranoia,
rapid physical decline,

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:53.668
ultimately premature death.

00:20:53.669 --> 00:20:56.462
But the females are
stronger than the males.

00:20:56.463 --> 00:20:57.672
More dominant.

00:20:57.673 --> 00:20:59.840
Has a Hyde ever taken on a new master?

00:20:59.841 --> 00:21:02.219
I mean, not that I know of.

00:21:03.053 --> 00:21:05.722
[chuckles] Who would be
reckless enough to try?

00:21:06.932 --> 00:21:11.227
I... I strongly recommend
that you don't entertain the idea.

00:21:11.228 --> 00:21:12.312
Of course not.

Sheriff, we've got multiple

Zombie's on a killing spree.

Everybody, clear out!

There's a killer zombie

- Slurp?
- Pugsley!

00:34:49.879 --> 00:34:52.881
- This is dangerous.
- Stay here. I don't want you to get hurt.

00:34:52.882 --> 00:34:54.883
Slurp's my friend. He'll listen to me.

Wait out here, please!

Stop.

00:35:44.684 --> 00:35:45.893
You can talk.

And you look human.

Whoever's in there, come out
with your hands over your head!

You've given me a second chance at life.
I don't want to waste it.

You're my only friend, Pugsley.

This is your final warning!

[Pugsley] Just me.

00:36:34.692 --> 00:36:36.110
No one else is in there.

Get the boy and his father out of here!
Move out.

Maybe it's for the best.

Oh, Lurch, be a dear
and bring the car around front.

Francoise.

00:37:38.047 --> 00:37:41.216
I was on my way to Nevermore

cutting roses in the moonlight.

00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:44.469
I couldn't believe it.

After all these years.

Gomez and I sent flowers to your funeral.

This girl.

She's your daughter?

Yes.

00:38:08.995 --> 00:38:10.538
She's an angel.

00:38:11.664 --> 00:38:13.708
I'd given up hope, and she...

00:38:15.001 --> 00:38:16.584
she saved me.

No, don't, don't. Please.

I'm being hunted.

You were always so kind to me in school.

I could really use your help
finding my son.

00:38:37.189 --> 00:38:38.398
You mean Tyler.

He escaped from Willow Hill too.

I know he's heading for Nevermore.

00:38:45.156 --> 00:38:47.198
In that case, I know who he's after.

[Dort] Tonight, we remember
those Outcasts who have gone before us.

What if Tyler's a no-show?

[Dort] The famous, the infamous,

and those whose shadow only loomed large
in the hearts of their loved ones.

We honor the Cyclops,
the Yeti, and the Minotaur,

and all the Outcast tribes
that no longer walk the earth.

00:39:36.123 --> 00:39:39.376
May their memory be a blessing.

00:39:39.377 --> 00:39:46.342
And may their absence be the bitter taste
that reminds us to always stay vigilant.

00:39:47.093 --> 00:39:49.427
He's here. Stick to the plan.

00:39:49.428 --> 00:39:51.263
I need Tyler to transform.

You're looking a little rough.

Is it because you killed your master?

You were right.

we can truly be together.

I had it under control.

One more word
and I'm taking you out of Nevermore.

- You just called that thing "Francoise."
- [Morticia] Yes.

- Yes.

What deal did you make?

Francoise gave me her word
that she would control Tyler,

and they'd leave Jericho forever.

I've always believed
that to be haunted is a choice.

What we are really haunted by is our past.

[Wednesday] Tyler and his mother
are now reunited.

Will Francoise keep her word
and go quietly into the night?

Or is she set on a darker purpose?
