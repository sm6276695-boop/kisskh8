Thank you.

00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:15.860
Come quick, look!

00:11:16.270 --> 00:11:16.890
What's wrong?

00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:18.750
Someone's collapsed over there.

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:30.090
Hello, Boss!

00:12:30.390 --> 00:12:31.650
What's wrong with you?

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:33.360
Fu Jun is dead.

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:34.360
Did you know that?

00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:35.500
What?

00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:37.080
The medical examiner says

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:38.280
it was a heart attack.

00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:39.960
He literally worked himself to death.

00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:41.200
Today, you brought a bunch of people

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:42.670
to help you check the cake.

00:12:42.690 --> 00:12:43.950
Did you find anything?

00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:46.030
You found nothing.

00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:47.510
What was the point of letting me

00:12:47.510 --> 00:12:48.600
hold Fu Jun back?

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:50.460
Making him pay more fines?

00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:52.790
He was desperately delivering food.

00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:53.510
His death

00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:55.510
is my fault.

00:12:57.840 --> 00:12:58.510
After midnight,

00:12:58.510 --> 00:12:59.840
he'll come back to life.

00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:00.670
Next time,

00:13:01.070 --> 00:13:02.460
we can change his fate.

Ms. Dong,

00:14:58.630 --> 00:14:59.870
we got caught up in small talk earlier,

00:14:59.870 --> 00:15:00.670
and I forgot to introduce you.

00:15:00.670 --> 00:15:01.550
This is our

00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:02.750
Assistant to the Chief Scientist,

00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:03.320
An Lan.

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:04.550
Hello, Ms. Dong.

00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:05.120
Nice to meet you.

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:06.000
Nice to meet you, too.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.440
Ms. Dong provided strong support

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:08.900
for our previous project.

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:09.960
And you've met Peter

00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:11.560
at the board meeting before.

00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:12.360
Nice to see you again.

00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:13.120
Nice to see you again.

00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:14.790
Peter is also

00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:15.720
Ms. Dong's husband.

00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:16.750
Hello, Mr. Han.

00:15:17.270 --> 00:15:18.800
Can I get your contact info?

00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:26.300
Mr. Gao.

00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:27.720
Long time no see.

00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:29.030
Hi, Mr. Mo!

00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:30.160
I'll leave you to it.

00:15:34.930 --> 00:15:36.600
Excuse me. Sorry to interrupt.

00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:37.600
Come here, An Lan.

00:15:37.630 --> 00:15:38.630
You guys go ahead.

00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:39.570
This is

00:15:39.870 --> 00:15:41.600
our Assistant to the Chief Scientist,

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:42.240
Miss An Lan.

00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:42.670
Hello.

00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:43.150
Nice to meet you.

00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:43.670
Hello.

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:45.290
Nice to meet you.

00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:47.410
Tang will have a worthy successor.

00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:48.870
Tang's departure

00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:50.030
has been difficult for all of us.

00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:50.910
But in terms of technology,

00:15:50.910 --> 00:15:51.840
we cannot stop.

00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:52.790
So now,

00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:54.550
we must fully trust

00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:55.710
An Lan's expertise.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.240
Under Mr. Mo's leadership,

00:15:57.240 --> 00:15:58.790
everything will certainly go smoothly.

00:15:58.790 --> 00:15:59.390
I'm flattered.

00:15:59.390 --> 00:16:01.190
Thank you for your trust, Mr. Mo.

00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:04.670
Mr. Han,

00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:06.270
could I add you?

00:16:08.670 --> 00:16:09.910
Distinguished guests,

00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:11.030
dear friends,

00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:12.720
the wedding ceremony

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:14.790
of Mr. Liu Haotian and Miss Zhao Zixin

00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:15.790
is about to begin.

00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:16.870
We kindly request all guests

00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:18.510
to take your seats now.

00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:20.520
Thank you for your attendance.

00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:24.320
The wedding ceremony

00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:25.670
of Mr. Liu Haotian and Miss Zhao Zixin

00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:29.080
now officially begins.

00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:32.240
Please give a warm welcome
to the happy couple.

00:16:57.390 --> 00:17:00.080
The couple will make their lifelong vows

00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:02.360
under the witness of the priest.

00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:04.520
Liu Haotian,

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:06.310
do you take

00:17:06.589 --> 00:17:08.680
Zhao Zixin to be your wife?

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:09.880
In sickness

00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:10.829
and in health,

00:17:11.109 --> 00:17:13.030
for richer or for poorer?

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:14.880
Do you?

00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:16.160
I do.

00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:17.960
Zhao Zixin,

00:17:18.349 --> 00:17:19.589
do you take

00:17:19.589 --> 00:17:21.589
Liu Haotian to be your husband?

00:17:22.030 --> 00:17:23.000
In sickness

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:23.960
and in health,

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:26.109
for richer or for poorer?

00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:27.400
Do you?

00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:29.160
I do.

00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:31.350
I now pronounce

00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:33.920
you husband and wife.

00:17:35.030 --> 00:17:36.960
Let's all give them our blessings.

00:17:37.550 --> 00:17:39.680
Thank you, priest, for your blessing.

00:17:40.110 --> 00:17:43.000
Now the couple will exchange
their tokens of love.

00:17:44.110 --> 00:17:46.240
Please pick up the rings.

00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:47.350
Mr. Liu Haotian,

00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:49.640
as the groom,

00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:50.790
please place

00:17:50.790 --> 00:17:53.190
this sacred ring on your beloved's finger.

00:17:53.310 --> 00:17:54.240
Similarly,

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:55.440
Ms. Zhao Zixin,

00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:57.640
as the bride,

00:17:57.640 --> 00:17:58.680
please place

00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:01.080
this sacred ring on your beloved's finger.

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:17.960
Now,

00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:20.310
you may kiss your bride.

00:18:22.750 --> 00:18:24.680
Let's all give them our blessings.

00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:34.680
At this moment,

00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:36.310
I am honored to announce—

00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:38.310
Peishan, follow her.

00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:39.680
Ms. Zhao Zixin...

00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:40.200
Roger.

00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:41.070
Wedding ceremony

00:18:41.070 --> 00:18:42.510
is now complete.

00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:45.920
Now,

00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:47.070
may I invite the newlyweds

00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:49.070
to step forward to the champagne tower

00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:49.550
to kick off...

00:18:49.550 --> 00:18:50.070
Fang Lu.

00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:50.920
The champagne celebration for us.

00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:51.480
Roger.

00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:54.680
Just as you begin

00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:56.480
your happy life together,

00:18:56.790 --> 00:18:58.440
please work together

00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:00.510
to pour and fill
the champagne tower before you.

00:19:00.510 --> 00:19:02.480
Just as you will join forces in life—

00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:03.570
In the previous loop,

00:19:03.570 --> 00:19:06.100
these three people
weren't on the death list.

00:19:06.550 --> 00:19:07.400
Did they leave

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:08.680
the explosion site at this time?

00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:10.240
And just like your love,

00:19:10.550 --> 00:19:12.720
may it flow endlessly.

00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:21.350
One, two, three.

00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:22.830
Okay.

00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:25.830
Thank you.

00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:28.750
You look beautiful.

00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:29.920
Long time no see.

00:20:08.620 --> 00:20:11.350
The time of the explosion
in the previous loop...

00:20:23.270 --> 00:20:25.000
Now let's invite our newlyweds

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.350
to share their sweet happiness

00:20:26.350 --> 00:20:28.590
with every one of the guests here.

00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:29.350
Please.

00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:35.800
Where's the bride?

00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:55.200
Help!

00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:56.240
Help me!

00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:57.110
Let go!

00:20:58.070 --> 00:20:58.960
Help!

00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:00.020
Who is this person?

00:21:00.270 --> 00:21:00.830
Let her go!

00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:01.790
Help!

00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:02.590
Help!

00:21:03.030 --> 00:21:03.680
Help me!

00:21:05.070 --> 00:21:05.750
Help!

00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:06.810
Put the knife down!

00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:09.030
Step back!

00:21:09.030 --> 00:21:09.720
We can talk this through.

00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:10.270
Let her go first.

00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:10.750
Tian...

00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:13.920
Calm down.

00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:14.750
Stay back!

00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:16.160
All of you, stay back!

00:21:25.310 --> 00:21:26.030
Help me!

00:21:26.550 --> 00:21:27.680
Help!

00:21:29.850 --> 00:21:30.510
Step back!

00:21:30.510 --> 00:21:31.110
Stay calm.

00:21:36.070 --> 00:21:36.790
Kai,

00:21:36.790 --> 00:21:38.270
protect Mo Yuanzhi and those around him.

00:21:38.270 --> 00:21:39.270
Calm down.

00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:39.880
Young man.

00:21:40.350 --> 00:21:41.030
Everyone else, stay put.

00:21:41.030 --> 00:21:41.890
I'll handle it.

00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:42.920
Calm down.

00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:43.880
Put the knife down.

00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:45.110
Don't hurt my daughter.

00:21:45.110 --> 00:21:47.000
You can have as much money as you want.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:47.640
Money?

00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:48.920
You're talking about money again?

00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:50.450
I'm going to kill all of you!

00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:54.350
Step back!

00:21:54.790 --> 00:21:55.920
Everyone step back!

00:22:09.790 --> 00:22:11.590
Didn't you say you'd wait for me?

00:22:17.510 --> 00:22:18.200
Why?

00:22:18.550 --> 00:22:19.880
It's not what you think.

00:39:24.590 --> 00:39:25.710
And the content of his speech

00:39:25.710 --> 00:39:27.550
will definitely be related
to Moma Biotechnology.

00:39:27.550 --> 00:39:28.760
The Squid's targets

00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:30.090
are Moma's executives.

00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:32.590
If Squid killed Mo Yuanzhi on site,

00:39:32.590 --> 00:39:34.920
that'd be the biggest humiliation to Moma.

00:39:34.920 --> 00:39:37.180
Isn't that exactly what the Squid wants?

00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:42.220
Don't forget to send me the call records.

00:40:18.030 --> 00:40:19.030
Morning, Mr. Mo.

00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:20.210
Morning, Qi.

00:40:24.150 --> 00:40:25.840
I heard you were still up at 4 AM.

00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:26.880
Did you have that much work to do?

00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:27.960
The company is in great turmoil,

00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:29.440
and there're lots of personnel changes.

00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:31.970
I was tied up
with calls and emails last night.

00:40:32.550 --> 00:40:34.110
At a time like this,

00:40:34.110 --> 00:40:36.310
staying disciplined is quite a luxury.

00:40:55.480 --> 00:40:56.510
The person who Mo Yuanzhi

00:40:56.510 --> 00:40:57.320
frequently contacted this morning

00:40:57.320 --> 00:40:58.110
is An Lan.

00:41:01.240 --> 00:41:02.770
Who initiated the contact?

00:41:03.070 --> 00:41:03.880
An Lan did.

00:41:08.140 --> 00:41:09.270
I want the contents.

00:41:12.030 --> 00:41:13.290
That'd be a violation.

00:41:17.380 --> 00:41:18.490
I want the contents.
