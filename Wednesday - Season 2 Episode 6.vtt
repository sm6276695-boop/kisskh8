00:10:13.696 --> 00:10:18.658
Enid, you transformed into a werewolf.

00:10:18.659 --> 00:10:21.161
Without a full moon. I saw you.

00:10:21.162 --> 00:10:23.247
[delicate, introspective music playing]

00:10:24.707 --> 00:10:25.916
Enid, it's okay.

00:10:28.002 --> 00:10:31.254
It... It means you could be an Alpha.

00:10:31.255 --> 00:10:32.340
[Enid gasps]

00:10:34.133 --> 00:10:36.176
Wait. Me?

00:10:36.177 --> 00:10:38.762
We don't know, but look at the facts.

00:10:38.763 --> 00:10:40.555
You're a late bloomer.

00:10:40.556 --> 00:10:44.100
The first time you wolfed out
was under a blood moon, correct?

00:10:44.101 --> 00:10:48.647
Those are all classic signs
of a potential Alpha.

00:10:48.648 --> 00:10:51.441
They're the strongest of our kind.
Very rare.

00:10:51.442 --> 00:10:53.818
If you are one, we have to manage it.

00:10:53.819 --> 00:10:55.363
[phone buzzing]

00:10:57.531 --> 00:10:59.658
But don't Alphas normally end up alone?

00:10:59.659 --> 00:11:03.203
Sorry. One minute. It's Principal Dort.

00:11:03.204 --> 00:11:04.996
We're implementing a new curfew.

00:11:04.997 --> 00:11:08.166
After dinner,
everyone's confined to their rooms.

00:11:08.167 --> 00:11:11.628
Anyone fails to comply,
barred... from the gala...

00:11:11.629 --> 00:11:12.837
Oh, Enid.

00:11:12.838 --> 00:11:14.256
Don't worry.

00:11:14.757 --> 00:11:17.926
There's a lot of misinformation out there

00:11:17.927 --> 00:11:20.387
about Alphas becoming lone wolves,

00:11:20.388 --> 00:11:25.351
but as long as we get this under control,
there's nothing to worry about.

00:11:26.352 --> 00:11:27.436
Okay?

00:11:30.439 --> 00:11:31.981

[Hester] Wednesday.

00:11:44.161 --> 00:11:47.665
What brings you all this way
on such a dreadful day?

00:11:48.249 --> 00:11:50.333
I need help restoring my psychic ability.

00:11:50.334 --> 00:11:53.253
The last time I intervened,
your mother burned that spell book.

00:11:53.254 --> 00:11:55.004
Yes, but you're a Raven.

00:11:55.005 --> 00:11:56.549
You must know another way.

00:11:57.550 --> 00:11:58.634
Pull.

00:12:04.432 --> 00:12:05.432
Every now and then,

00:12:05.433 --> 00:12:09.060
I crank up my psychic sight
so I can spy on old enemies.

00:12:09.061 --> 00:12:13.107
Just a few flashes of their suffering.
Usually brightens my mood.

00:12:13.691 --> 00:12:15.943
You stopped using it
after what happened to Aunt Ophelia.

00:12:17.695 --> 00:12:19.530
Is that what your mother told you?

00:12:21.073 --> 00:12:23.199
Doves can be so emotional,

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:28.997
always living in the past
and wallowing in their feelings.

00:12:28.998 --> 00:12:31.791
I made a choice to leave all that behind.

00:12:31.792 --> 00:12:35.004
Women like us can't be burdened by family.

00:12:35.546 --> 00:12:38.966
We forge our own path, dig our own grave.

00:12:42.011 --> 00:12:44.555
This is one of the Hydes
I accidentally released at Willow Hill.

00:12:45.639 --> 00:12:47.098

[suspicious music playing]

00:12:49.894 --> 00:12:53.230
Have you ever come across
the name Rosaline Rotwood?

00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:56.859
Professor Rotwood was a legendary Raven.

00:12:57.735 --> 00:13:02.490
She taught runes and ancient cryptology
during my time at Nevermore.

00:13:03.365 --> 00:13:04.824
I was an amateur tomb raider,

00:13:04.825 --> 00:13:07.952
so I took to that class
like a leech to blood.

00:13:07.953 --> 00:13:11.206
In fact, your parents
are slumming in her old cottage.

00:13:11.207 --> 00:13:14.959
She used to hold secret soirées
in her seance chamber.

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:17.379
She may have served stale sherry,

00:13:18.172 --> 00:13:21.049
but her psychic sight was extraordinary.

00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:23.511
What does this
have to do with my situation?

00:13:25.846 --> 00:13:30.142
Rotwood is buried
in the Nevermore graveyard.

00:13:30.851 --> 00:13:34.521
Her headstone is imbued
with her dark energy.

00:13:34.522 --> 00:13:38.108
If a Raven recites the inscription
etched underneath,

00:13:38.776 --> 00:13:41.195
you will be granted temporary sight.

00:13:45.157 --> 00:13:46.450
Thank you, Grandmama.

00:13:47.785 --> 00:13:51.663
I'm the last person to offer advice,
and you're the last person to accept any,

00:13:51.664 --> 00:13:54.792
but... proceed with caution, my dear.

00:13:57.044 --> 00:13:58.212

Oh, there you are.

00:14:13.269 --> 00:14:15.562
Dort turned dinner
into a campus safety TED talk.

00:14:15.563 --> 00:14:17.606
Ugh, I had to escape.

00:14:19.191 --> 00:14:22.443
- Where are you charging off to?
- The Nevermore graveyard.

00:14:22.444 --> 00:14:24.196
Hello? Curfew!

00:14:24.697 --> 00:14:27.448
If you're not back, the entire dorm is
gonna be barred from the gala.

00:14:27.449 --> 00:14:29.450
You may have dropped out of the orchestra,

00:14:29.451 --> 00:14:32.161
but I've been rehearsing
my dance routine for weeks.

00:14:32.162 --> 00:14:35.748
I'm not cowering away in the room
while Tyler and his mother are out there.

00:14:35.749 --> 00:14:37.333
I'm going to find them.

00:14:37.334 --> 00:14:38.543
How exactly?

00:14:38.544 --> 00:14:42.298
That's on a need-to-know basis.
After last night, you don't need to know.

00:14:43.424 --> 00:14:46.634
Did it ever occur to you
that we're all just trying our best?

00:14:46.635 --> 00:14:50.680
Trying your best means you're planning
on failing and letting me know in advance.

00:14:50.681 --> 00:14:52.849
The fact that you can be so arrogant

00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:55.393
and still make
so many bad decisions is staggering.

00:14:55.394 --> 00:14:58.646
How was I supposed to know
that Tyler's mother was still alive?

00:14:58.647 --> 00:15:00.773
You weren't! That's the whole point.

00:15:00.774 --> 00:15:04.986
Your arsonist-slash-firefighter complex
is right there in black and white.

00:15:04.987 --> 00:15:08.198
You unleash chaos just so you can
stamp it out and then feel superior.

00:15:09.199 --> 00:15:11.911
You think you're powerful now
because you finally wolfed out?

00:15:12.953 --> 00:15:15.956
[breathing tremulously]
You have no idea what I'm capable of.

00:15:16.749 --> 00:15:18.625
Now who sounds arrogant?

00:15:18.626 --> 00:15:21.837
Have you ever put yourself in someone
else's shoes to see how they felt?

00:15:23.672 --> 00:15:26.799
My shoes are filled
with broken glass and razor blades.

You'd bleed out after two steps.

How long until she gets up here?

00:16:02.836 --> 00:16:05.296
That's barely enough time
to make it to the graveyard and back.

I am not missing that gala!

00:16:07.299 --> 00:16:10.761

How dare you enter my chamber uninvited?

00:17:07.234 --> 00:17:08.402
I'm a Raven.

00:17:10.154 --> 00:17:12.071
One whose wings have been clipped.

00:17:12.072 --> 00:17:15.533
My grandmother told me that if I read
the inscription on your grave,

00:17:15.534 --> 00:17:17.118
you would grant me second sight.

00:17:17.119 --> 00:17:18.203
[chuckles]

00:17:18.704 --> 00:17:19.705
Hester.

00:17:21.582 --> 00:17:23.917
So desperate for my approval.

00:17:24.877 --> 00:17:29.047
But she never had what it took
to be a truly great Raven.

00:17:29.048 --> 00:17:34.010
She craved a family so badly,
she fell head over heels with a huckster.

00:17:34.011 --> 00:17:36.971
I sense none of that
sentimentality in you.

00:17:36.972 --> 00:17:41.018
No. The crack in your monochrome armor is

00:17:41.518 --> 00:17:42.895
overbearing arrogance.

00:17:44.605 --> 00:17:46.314

I need to find them.

00:17:51.361 --> 00:17:54.490
There's no time to waste.
A life hangs in the balance.

00:17:55.657 --> 00:17:58.744
What are you willing to endure
to excavate the truth?

00:18:00.496 --> 00:18:02.288
Hold your hand over the flame,

00:18:02.289 --> 00:18:05.374
and your psychic sight will be
temporarily renewed.

00:18:05.375 --> 00:18:06.751
But beware.

00:18:06.752 --> 00:18:08.836
If you pull your palm from the flame,

00:18:08.837 --> 00:18:11.924
you will break the Raven's gaze, and...

00:18:13.133 --> 00:18:15.302
there will be a price to pay.

Because we've somehow swapped bodies.

I don't understand.

We were at the graveyard,
and now we're here, and now it's morning.

How the hell did that happen?

00:19:38.177 --> 00:19:40.220
You broke the Raven's gaze.

Now it's playing a dirty trick.

00:19:42.347 --> 00:19:43.849
How do we swap back?

You always think
you're the smartest person in the room.

Nobody can see us like this, okay?

00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:33.481
We'll pretend we have
a contagious disease,

This must remain our secret.

You need to stay away from Bruno.

We got this, right?

00:21:12.562 --> 00:21:14.981

to act like Wednesday Addams?

Over here. Saved you a seat.

00:21:20.487 --> 00:21:21.697

Hmm.

00:21:44.344 --> 00:21:46.595
Your braids are fire, Elise.

00:21:46.596 --> 00:21:48.640
And those shoes are a vibe, Sophia.

Pugsley's zombie.

[gasps] Duh! Right. I'm clearly suffering
from extreme caffeine deprivation.

Oh, dear.

I haven't seen
your skin break out like that

00:23:40.585 --> 00:23:44.214
since Pugsley colored
the inside of your favorite death mask.

00:23:44.714 --> 00:23:47.049
Hmm. I have just the remedy.

Wow!

00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:03.942
This cream is amazing.

00:24:05.527 --> 00:24:09.739
- What's in it?
- Beeswax, stinging nettles, and ash.

00:24:11.366 --> 00:24:12.199
Ash?

Scraped from the bottom
of a crematorium furnace.

One of your grandmama's beauty secrets.

Although it does give your skin
that wonderful corpse-like glow.

00:24:22.711 --> 00:24:23.712
Well...

00:24:24.379 --> 00:24:25.337
Thanks, Mom.

Mom?

That's new.

00:24:28.425 --> 00:24:31.260
Hmm. Something's different
about you today.

00:24:31.261 --> 00:24:33.637
I can see it in your eyes.

It's like your spirit is lighter.

with a touch of enthusiasm.

Why didn't you take
your umbra mushroom pills?

00:24:47.694 --> 00:24:51.280
You know you run the risk
of an allergic reaction if you skip a day.

00:24:51.281 --> 00:24:53.200
Oh. Right.

00:24:54.159 --> 00:24:55.910
My prescription ran out.

00:24:55.911 --> 00:24:59.788
Well, luckily, I stopped by the apothecary
and picked up your refill.

00:24:59.789 --> 00:25:01.957
This will clear it right up.

[chuckling] Oh.

00:25:12.427 --> 00:25:14.386
Uh, tonight's not great for me.

Pugsley's coming over.

00:25:15.764 --> 00:25:17.223
And your father's up from the city,

00:25:17.224 --> 00:25:20.351
and you know how much
family dinners cool his heart.

But I can't.

Well, I've already spoken to him,

00:25:30.111 --> 00:25:32.446
and he's given you and Pugsley
a pass for tonight.

Isn't that wonderful?

Lurch will pick you up at 7:00.

00:25:38.161 --> 00:25:39.538

into uncharted territory.

Fine.

I haven't the foggiest.

But given my penchant
for meticulous research,

00:26:22.122 --> 00:26:24.456
I did discover that two other Ravens

00:26:24.457 --> 00:26:28.712
had the audacity to embark
on this foolhardy endeavor before you.

00:26:29.212 --> 00:26:32.757
- What happened to them?
- They were both dead within 24 hours.

Bravo, Miss Addams.

- Yeah.

[Isaac] I could still help you.

It was always my dream.

00:30:02.509 --> 00:30:04.343
To slay the monster inside you.

00:30:04.344 --> 00:30:06.345
I only need the right equipment.

And he's built a version
of your machine at Willow Hill.

But he perverted it
to give our abilities to Normies.

she's carrying on his research.

I can save you.

[Tyler] You can't be serious.

00:30:43.216 --> 00:30:47.177
You want to go back to Willow Hill?
The place we all just escaped from?

00:30:47.178 --> 00:30:49.054
[Isaac] Yes, I do.

00:30:49.055 --> 00:30:53.893
But, first, I need to visit an old friend...

Why didn't you tell me you played?

I only do it when I need to think.

00:31:42.734 --> 00:31:45.695
Sounds like you're channeling
your inner Wednesday.

00:31:48.364 --> 00:31:50.115
You have no idea.

00:31:50.116 --> 00:31:52.827
We need to talk about your situation.

My situation?

Little guy ran out right in front of us.

00:45:36.108 --> 00:45:38.152
Lurch backed up over it twice.

00:45:38.652 --> 00:45:39.986
Tenderized it. Ooh, yeah.

00:45:39.987 --> 00:45:43.322
He also added a little leftover raccoon,

00:45:43.323 --> 00:45:47.410
which gives that
special woodsy flavor you adore.

00:45:47.411 --> 00:45:48.661
[weakly] Mmm.

00:45:48.662 --> 00:45:50.037
[glass clinking]

00:45:50.038 --> 00:45:51.540
[Lurch groans]

00:45:52.332 --> 00:45:56.085
Now that we're all here together,
it's time for a serious discussion.

00:45:56.086 --> 00:46:00.631
Your father and I have tried to instill
our family values in you children.

00:46:00.632 --> 00:46:02.760
But we draw the line on lying.

00:46:03.635 --> 00:46:06.053
I thought you said lying
was an important life skill.

00:46:06.054 --> 00:46:09.015
Yes, like in business, politics,

00:46:09.016 --> 00:46:10.767
jury duty... that's a big one.

00:46:10.768 --> 00:46:14.146
You two have been lying to us.

00:46:14.646 --> 00:46:17.857
And I'll give you one chance to confess.

00:46:17.858 --> 00:46:21.820
- There's still a punishment, right?
- Of course. Don't be silly.

00:46:25.157 --> 00:46:26.617
I lied to you about Slurp.

00:46:27.451 --> 00:46:30.662
I saw him at Pilgrim World,
and I let him go.

00:46:31.538 --> 00:46:32.539
I'm really sorry, Pop.

00:46:33.957 --> 00:46:35.292
So, um...

00:46:36.126 --> 00:46:37.920
do I get the rack or iron maiden?

00:46:38.754 --> 00:46:39.755
We'll flip for it.

00:46:40.589 --> 00:46:42.216
Come on. Let's go.

00:46:43.550 --> 00:46:45.426
Please excuse us.

00:46:45.427 --> 00:46:47.638
You ladies enjoy dinner.

00:46:48.972 --> 00:46:54.685
Earlier, I caught Enid in
Rosaline Rotwood's secret seance chamber.

00:46:54.686 --> 00:46:56.605
Any idea why she was snooping?

00:46:57.689 --> 00:46:59.608
None, actually.

00:47:00.192 --> 00:47:01.193
Hmm.

00:47:02.611 --> 00:47:06.030
I see that bewildered look in your eyes.

00:47:06.031 --> 00:47:08.116
It's the same look I noticed this morning.

00:47:08.700 --> 00:47:11.369
- [Enid whimpers]
- And now it makes sense.

00:47:11.370 --> 00:47:13.871
Your obsession
for getting your ability back

00:47:13.872 --> 00:47:16.958
has finally made you lose your mind.

00:47:16.959 --> 00:47:17.917
What?

00:47:17.918 --> 00:47:19.502
But don't worry.

00:47:19.503 --> 00:47:21.839
I will have Lurch make up the guest room.

00:47:22.381 --> 00:47:25.091
No, that... that...
that really isn't necessary.

00:47:25.092 --> 00:47:28.803
I sense your presence again.
Show yourself.

00:47:28.804 --> 00:47:30.471
I demand it.

00:47:30.472 --> 00:47:33.641
You're still as insufferably bossy
as you were in 10th grade.

00:47:33.642 --> 00:47:34.810
Larissa?

00:47:35.477 --> 00:47:37.228
- Who's Larissa?
- Shh!

00:47:37.229 --> 00:47:39.188
Morticia, it's good to see you.

00:47:39.189 --> 00:47:40.690
Oh, I just remembered. I--

00:47:40.691 --> 00:47:41.817
Sit down.

00:47:44.069 --> 00:47:47.281
I am Wednesday's new spirit guide.

00:47:48.115 --> 00:47:49.156
Wait.

00:47:49.157 --> 00:47:51.660
If you're her guide,
why can't she see you?

00:47:52.244 --> 00:47:54.662
[Weems]
At your beloved mother's suggestion,

00:47:54.663 --> 00:47:57.748
Wednesday attempted to gain
temporary second sight

00:47:57.749 --> 00:48:00.502
at Rosaline Rotwood's headstone.

00:48:02.087 --> 00:48:05.339
That's why she dispatched Enid
to search for answers

00:48:05.340 --> 00:48:07.925
in Rotwood's seance chamber.

00:48:07.926 --> 00:48:09.553
Except that wasn't Enid.

00:48:10.429 --> 00:48:11.763
It was Wednesday.

00:48:14.182 --> 00:48:15.058
Enid?

00:48:15.893 --> 00:48:17.811
Is that you in there?

00:48:18.395 --> 00:48:19.688
Where's Wednesday?

00:48:21.064 --> 00:48:23.316
Locked in the Lupin cages
until the morning.

00:48:23.317 --> 00:48:24.567
It'll be too late.

00:48:24.568 --> 00:48:27.613
They only have until dawn
to set this right.

00:48:28.113 --> 00:48:30.239
We can't help them, Morticia.

00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:32.325
They have to save themselves.

00:48:32.326 --> 00:48:33.451
Mrs. Addams, I--

00:48:33.452 --> 00:48:37.706
You must free Wednesday
and fix this together before dawn.

00:48:39.249 --> 00:48:40.625
That's your only chance.

00:48:40.626 --> 00:48:42.711
[grim, distressing music playing]

00:49:01.730 --> 00:49:03.732
[wheels buzzing]

00:49:04.775 --> 00:49:07.152
[Isaac] I hope
I'm not late for the meeting.

00:49:13.659 --> 00:49:14.784
Hello, Professor.

00:49:14.785 --> 00:49:15.953
[shocked gasp]

00:49:16.954 --> 00:49:20.122
Don't you recognize your star student?

00:49:20.123 --> 00:49:22.042
It can't be.

00:49:22.709 --> 00:49:26.088
Isaac Night disappeared

00:49:26.672 --> 00:49:27.880
30 years ago.

00:49:27.881 --> 00:49:31.009
Correction, Professor.
I died 30 years ago.

00:49:32.761 --> 00:49:35.389
Never underestimate the power of science.

00:49:36.848 --> 00:49:38.516
Isn't that what you told me?

00:49:38.517 --> 00:49:40.686
Science has nothing to do with it.

00:49:41.728 --> 00:49:44.730
You're a perversion of nature.

00:49:44.731 --> 00:49:46.692
Says the talking head in a jar.

00:49:49.277 --> 00:49:50.779
But you're only alive...

00:49:52.030 --> 00:49:53.280
because of me.

00:49:53.281 --> 00:49:54.490
[chilling music playing]

00:49:54.491 --> 00:49:59.704
My invention has given you
30 years of borrowed time.

00:49:59.705 --> 00:50:01.081
[gears whirring frantically]

00:50:02.457 --> 00:50:04.418
And now I've come to collect.

00:50:05.252 --> 00:50:07.337
Isaac! Don't!

00:50:09.047 --> 00:50:11.049
No! Stop!

00:50:12.592 --> 00:50:13.634
Isaac!

00:50:13.635 --> 00:50:14.719
[energy crackles]

00:50:14.720 --> 00:50:16.805
[Orloff straining]

00:50:21.309 --> 00:50:23.061
Don't worry, Professor.

00:50:24.187 --> 00:50:28.941
I wouldn't let
such a great mind go to waste.

00:50:28.942 --> 00:50:30.527
[chilling music intensifies]

00:50:37.075 --> 00:50:39.077
[wet crunching, smacking in distance]

00:50:50.338 --> 00:50:51.338
[shrieks]

00:50:51.339 --> 00:50:52.299
[jarring stinger]

00:51:09.816 --> 00:51:10.942
[breathing shakily]

00:51:28.794 --> 00:51:30.669
- [Isaac chuckles]
- [Francoise] Mmm.

00:51:30.670 --> 00:51:32.089
What is that?

00:51:34.341 --> 00:51:36.592
A power source
for the machine at Willow Hill.

00:51:36.593 --> 00:51:39.137
Since their whole
electrical system was fried.

00:51:40.013 --> 00:51:41.013
[bird cawing in distance]

00:51:41.014 --> 00:51:42.432
[sinister music playing]

00:51:43.475 --> 00:51:44.476
[whispers] Tyler.

00:51:45.560 --> 00:51:46.937
Check outside.

00:51:55.612 --> 00:51:56.613
[faint thud]

00:52:04.412 --> 00:52:05.663
[jolting stinger]

00:52:05.664 --> 00:52:06.748
[gasps softly]

00:52:18.051 --> 00:52:19.052
Okay?

00:52:19.845 --> 00:52:21.095
- It's nothing.
- Okay.

00:52:21.096 --> 00:52:22.180
Seat belts.

00:52:23.682 --> 00:52:24.683
Tyler.

00:52:57.591 --> 00:53:00.260
Your little creeper told me
about your vision of my death.

00:53:01.344 --> 00:53:02.721
Thanks for the trust.

00:53:06.850 --> 00:53:09.351
I also know
that if we don't switch back by dawn,

00:53:09.352 --> 00:53:10.895
we're both going to die.

00:53:10.896 --> 00:53:13.273
And I am not checking out
looking like this.

00:53:14.524 --> 00:53:15.525
[phone buzzing]

00:53:19.237 --> 00:53:20.446
[Enid huffs]

00:53:20.447 --> 00:53:21.572
[phone bleeps]

00:53:21.573 --> 00:53:24.909
[Agnes] Wednesday...
I know we currently aren't friends,

00:53:24.910 --> 00:53:26.620
but I found them.

00:53:27.495 --> 00:53:30.581
I found Tyler Galpin and Isaac Night.

00:53:30.582 --> 00:53:33.042
I took a leaf out of
your detecting playbook.

00:53:33.043 --> 00:53:35.921
I'm currently hiding in their trunk
along with a very...

00:53:36.922 --> 00:53:37.964
very dead body.

00:53:38.548 --> 00:53:40.216
At least somebody stayed on task.

00:53:40.217 --> 00:53:42.802
Agnes, are you insane?
Get the hell out of there!

00:53:43.386 --> 00:53:44.304
No.

00:53:44.804 --> 00:53:45.805
It's too late.

00:53:47.432 --> 00:53:49.392
Sharing my location with you now.

00:53:53.104 --> 00:53:54.104
[phone beeping]

00:53:54.105 --> 00:53:57.024
- They're headed to Willow Hill.
- We need to switch back.

00:53:57.025 --> 00:53:59.152
After we save Agnes
and take down the Galpins.

00:54:01.029 --> 00:54:02.030
[music fades]

00:54:04.991 --> 00:54:06.243
[energy humming]

00:54:17.879 --> 00:54:20.673
I can finally keep
that promise I made to you.

00:54:20.674 --> 00:54:24.427
- [Francoise, fondly] Hmm.
- To free you from this horrible curse.

00:54:26.638 --> 00:54:27.639
[Isaac] Here.

00:54:30.308 --> 00:54:32.769
- We have to secure you for the procedure.
- Yeah.

00:54:34.771 --> 00:54:37.190
You think being a Hyde is a curse?

00:54:38.275 --> 00:54:40.402
It's the most free I've ever felt.

00:54:42.153 --> 00:54:44.739
[Francoise] That so-called freedom
comes at a price.

00:54:45.323 --> 00:54:48.410
Every transformation has a human cost.

00:54:49.202 --> 00:54:51.204
Until it finally steals your life.

00:54:53.957 --> 00:54:57.710
I designed this machine
to remove Outcast abilities.

00:54:57.711 --> 00:55:01.213
{\an8}If I can take away
your mother's Hyde side,

00:55:01.214 --> 00:55:03.049
{\an8}I can stop her from dying.

00:55:16.313 --> 00:55:17.314
[phone bleeps]

00:55:28.074 --> 00:55:29.242
[faint clink in distance]

00:55:30.076 --> 00:55:31.577
Someone else is here.

00:55:31.578 --> 00:55:32.787
[Isaac] Uh...

00:55:40.628 --> 00:55:41.880
[Agnes gasps]

00:55:42.839 --> 00:55:44.966
Little snoop is
one of Wednesday's friends.

00:55:45.800 --> 00:55:47.552
What do you want me to do with her?

00:55:49.429 --> 00:55:50.847
Put her in a cell.

00:55:52.098 --> 00:55:54.059
I'll need a snack once I'm done.

00:55:55.060 --> 00:55:56.061
[Agnes straining]

00:55:57.187 --> 00:55:59.397
This way! The lab is through that door.

00:56:00.398 --> 00:56:02.484
[Agnes pants] Ah!

00:56:11.618 --> 00:56:13.870
[Isaac hums softly]

00:56:16.790 --> 00:56:18.500
[Tyler] Make yourself at home.

00:56:19.918 --> 00:56:22.045
We can deal with
that Nevermore brat later.

00:56:23.922 --> 00:56:25.215
[Isaac] Ready, Francoise?

00:56:29.010 --> 00:56:30.011
[machinery humming]

00:56:55.578 --> 00:56:56.621
Wednesday!

00:57:08.591 --> 00:57:09.551
[door opens]

00:57:10.301 --> 00:57:11.761
Look who showed up.

00:57:12.637 --> 00:57:14.596
- Don't forget about me.
- [Tyler grunts]

00:57:14.597 --> 00:57:16.932
- [Wednesday] Leave her alone!
- No full moon to save you--

00:57:16.933 --> 00:57:18.184
[Tyler grunts]

00:57:19.519 --> 00:57:21.146
[panting]

00:57:26.484 --> 00:57:28.319
[chains rattling]

00:57:30.238 --> 00:57:31.239
[Agnes] Wednesday?

00:57:32.991 --> 00:57:35.576
You need to calm down
or you're gonna wolf out.

00:57:35.577 --> 00:57:37.828
Too late. Get out!

00:57:37.829 --> 00:57:39.914
[flesh distending, bones cracking]

00:57:42.375 --> 00:57:43.793
[Wednesday groaning]

00:57:51.593 --> 00:57:53.720
[machinery whirring intensifying]

00:58:04.272 --> 00:58:05.273
[Isaac sputtering]

00:58:10.403 --> 00:58:12.238
[exhales] Wednesday.

00:58:15.450 --> 00:58:16.451
[forceful pounding]

00:58:17.368 --> 00:58:19.245
[pounding continues]

00:58:24.375 --> 00:58:25.876
[heroic music swelling]

00:58:25.877 --> 00:58:26.961
[Wednesday snarling]

00:58:36.346 --> 00:58:37.847
Tyler, no!

00:58:49.275 --> 00:58:51.528
Wednesday? Wednesday!

00:58:52.320 --> 00:58:54.112
Wednesday, we have to go now!

00:58:54.113 --> 00:58:55.490
[uncontrollable whirring]

00:59:00.078 --> 00:59:02.205
[heightened, suspenseful music playing]

00:59:08.378 --> 00:59:09.546
Let's go!

00:59:11.089 --> 00:59:13.007
[Francoise] Go! Gotta get out of here!

00:59:19.097 --> 00:59:21.099
[music trails off]

00:59:26.604 --> 00:59:27.604
Are you okay?

00:59:27.605 --> 00:59:30.233
[breathing heavily]

00:59:31.234 --> 00:59:33.110
[delicate, emotional music playing]

00:59:33.111 --> 00:59:34.904
Thank you for saving my life.

00:59:37.365 --> 00:59:40.410
I just asked myself, "What would Enid do?"

00:59:42.912 --> 00:59:46.456
So you guys did swap bodies.
I knew something was up.

00:59:46.457 --> 00:59:49.167
You've been acting really weird all day.

00:59:49.168 --> 00:59:52.088
And you just called her
Wednesday back there, so...

00:59:52.839 --> 00:59:54.257
we're still friends.

00:59:55.425 --> 00:59:58.802
Well, don't worry. It's okay.
It's really hard for me too.

00:59:58.803 --> 01:00:01.848
But we'll get used to
this whole new look together.

01:00:04.517 --> 01:00:07.520
Not if I can help it.
Agnes, go back to Nevermore.

01:00:08.813 --> 01:00:10.063
Um...

01:00:10.064 --> 01:00:11.399
Where are we going?

01:00:11.899 --> 01:00:14.527
[grim, imposing music playing]

01:00:18.781 --> 01:00:19.781
Now what?

01:00:19.782 --> 01:00:21.158
Rotwood said we had to unravel

01:00:21.159 --> 01:00:23.870
the innermost secrets
of the lives we stepped into.

01:00:30.585 --> 01:00:32.295
[scoffs] Fine.

01:00:32.837 --> 01:00:33.838
I'll go first.

01:00:35.548 --> 01:00:37.508
You know what I love
about being Wednesday?

01:00:38.426 --> 01:00:39.719
Your fearlessness.

01:00:40.803 --> 01:00:43.931
Except when it comes to your mom.
But... I get it.

01:00:45.099 --> 01:00:47.018
[sighs] She can be a lot.

01:00:48.269 --> 01:00:50.605
You're afraid she'll never accept you
for who you truly are.

01:00:51.773 --> 01:00:54.858
That your darkness
is even too much for her to grasp.

01:00:54.859 --> 01:00:57.819
You'll become the disappointment
she'll never want to speak of.

01:00:57.820 --> 01:00:59.237
Just like your aunt.

01:00:59.238 --> 01:01:01.074
I can feel it in your bones.

01:01:02.408 --> 01:01:03.868
That's why you push her away.

01:01:05.244 --> 01:01:07.746
But maybe she has
more to teach you than you think.

01:01:07.747 --> 01:01:09.832
[introspective music playing]

01:01:13.878 --> 01:01:16.589
The best thing about being Enid
is your quiet strength.

01:01:17.340 --> 01:01:19.634
You think being an Alpha
will mean you'll be alone.

01:01:20.468 --> 01:01:21.928
I won't let that happen.

01:01:22.428 --> 01:01:25.180
You need to stop trying so hard
for people who don't deserve it.

01:01:25.181 --> 01:01:28.558
Like Bruno, who mistook
your kindness for weakness.

01:01:28.559 --> 01:01:29.685
It's not.

01:01:29.686 --> 01:01:31.187
It's your power.

01:01:31.979 --> 01:01:33.689
Which I could barely handle for one night.

01:01:33.690 --> 01:01:34.774
[chuckles softly]

01:01:37.110 --> 01:01:38.568
[emotional music building]

01:01:38.569 --> 01:01:41.030
I regret ever underestimating you.

01:01:42.699 --> 01:01:44.200
[emotional music swells]

01:01:54.919 --> 01:01:56.169
[music trails off]

01:01:56.170 --> 01:01:57.255
Oh my God.

01:01:58.297 --> 01:01:59.589
Wednesday!

01:01:59.590 --> 01:02:00.633
We're alive!

01:02:02.009 --> 01:02:04.554
I feel so warm and fuzzy!

01:02:05.805 --> 01:02:07.806
And I feel as cold as a cadaver.

01:02:07.807 --> 01:02:11.853
Which means I'm me and you're you! Ah!

01:02:13.604 --> 01:02:14.647
[jolting stinger]

01:02:15.148 --> 01:02:16.149
Enid.

01:02:17.275 --> 01:02:19.985
Why don't you go back
to the dorm and get changed?

01:02:19.986 --> 01:02:21.319
I'll be right behind you.

01:02:21.320 --> 01:02:24.406
Good idea.
I could seriously use a bubble bath.

01:02:24.407 --> 01:02:26.492
[moody, uneasy music playing]

01:02:36.961 --> 01:02:40.131
The premonition of
Enid's imminent death is no more.

01:02:40.715 --> 01:02:42.341
So why the dour face?

01:02:43.509 --> 01:02:46.679
Your actions today
have put another life at risk.

01:02:48.931 --> 01:02:49.849
Follow me.

01:02:54.896 --> 01:02:55.897
[birds cawing]

01:03:04.530 --> 01:03:06.824
[Weems] An Addams must die.

01:03:07.950 --> 01:03:09.619
The question is...

01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:12.788
which one?

01:03:12.789 --> 01:03:14.874
[moody music intensifying]

01:03:17.168 --> 01:03:18.084
[music trails off]

01:03:18.085 --> 01:03:20.171
[jauntily macabre outro music playing]
