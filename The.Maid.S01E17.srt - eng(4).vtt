00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:38.200
Not every man

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.720
deserves fatherhood.

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.760
His Highness

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.440
doesn't want to confront the Duke.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:44.880
My lady,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.560
it'll be even more perilous this time.

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:48.920
He has those he must protect.

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.880
And I have vengeance to pursue.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:55.960
We're not on the same path.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.040
Concubine Ye,

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.600
I bring word from His Highness.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.200
Congratulations on becoming
a secondary consort.

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.000
He requests

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.480
that you put on ornaments

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:15.520
and go to the main hall

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.760
to receive formal congratulations.

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:27.880
Why would you

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:28.960
elevate her status now

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.200
and make it know to all?

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.640
Do you also believe

00:02:34.438 --> 00:02:35.968
I'm bewitched by the demoness

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.960
and lost my mind?

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:38.840
The Duke plays both sides,

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.120
profiting from both you
and the Empress Dowager

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.240
to expand the Western Army.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.160
Your actions

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.920
amount to challenging the Duke directly,

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.710
forcing him to ally
with the Empress Dowager.

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.440
Whether I promote Consort Ye or not,

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:51.520
I can't stop his scheme

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:52.920
with the Empress Dowager.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.200
I'm not so base

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.720
as to use a woman

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:00.560
as a shield.

00:03:08.384 --> 00:03:10.200
You've developed feelings
for Consort Ye.

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.280
You want to protect her.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.360
You may deceive others,

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.080
but not yourself.

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.120
But Your Highness,

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.880
how much sincerity
does she hold for you?

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.720
You could have ascended the throne,

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:35.560
but you chose

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:36.560
to maintain peace

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:37.722
through restrained diplomacy.

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:39.920
But now, this move of yours

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.560
will destroy everything

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.920
you've painstakingly built.

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.200
Nanxing, my beauty.

00:04:03.667 --> 00:04:04.832
(Lady Zheng,
Female Official of Imperial Observatory)

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:09.640
These past few days,

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.280
my darling Nanxing,

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.000
I was going stir-crazy...

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:17.440
Lady Zheng?

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.688
You...

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:20.560
Why are you here?

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.520
Why do you meet me at Meixiang House?

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.160
My lord,

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.360
the demoness scheme I devised for you

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.120
has only just begun.

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.840
Would you abandon me now?

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.600
I must consider the broader situation.

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.560
You sent me
into the Imperial Observatory.

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.040
I tread on thin ice
by the Empress Dowager's side,

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:45.920
scheming for you and the Western Army.

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.240
Have you forgotten?

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:51.240
My darling.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.672
Don't cry.

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:56.080
Wait a bit longer.

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.720
Jin's position in the mansion
is unstable.

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.200
We must curb Pei Ji's arrogance

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:04.480
and establish authority.

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.720
When Pei Ji eventually falls...

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.800
But Pei Ji doesn't believe
in spirits or demons.

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:19.168
He even promotes Ye Xiyan
to secondary consort

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.480
and publicly vows to protect her.

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.480
Do you think

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.800
a mere prophecy

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:26.800
could hurt them?

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.512
What clever plan
do you propose, my dear?

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:34.880
Do you know

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:37.920
what's most precious in this world?

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:42.320
Beautiful women, of course!

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:49.120
In this world,

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:52.960
only lost things become truly precious.

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:02.720
The Western Army enjoys ample funds

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:04.320
with minimal campaigns.

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:06.960
If suddenly deprived,

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:08.960
what do you think will happen?

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:14.280
And if they lose it
because of that demoness?

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:33.000
Mutiny.

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:39.000
Now, all four Western Army commanders

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.400
came to mourn.

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:42.080
All our troops

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:44.240
are camped outside the city.

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:48.160
How to ensure complete success?

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:54.320
My lord,

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:55.560
the only thing needed

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:57.960
is your death.

00:07:03.904 --> 00:07:04.840
Explain yourself.

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:06.960
I observed the heavens.

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:09.040
Something will happen tonight.

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:25.720
I won't disturb your enjoyment.

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:28.960
My lady, don't go.

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:31.520
My lady, please don't leave.

00:07:33.952 --> 00:07:35.520
My darling Nanxing,

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:37.320
you've finally come.

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:39.520
Let's go.

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:46.160
My dear,

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:48.160
I'm here.

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:04.040
Capture the assassin!

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:05.560
Over there!

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:06.520
Catch him!

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:45.120
Is there anything inappropriate

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:46.960
about my makeup today?

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:55.560
You've always been too coquettish.

00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:57.920
It always feels artificial to me.

00:08:59.160 --> 00:08:59.840
Today,

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:01.520
you seem more like your true self.

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:08.880
The Astronomer of Imperial Observatory
has arrived.

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:12.000
Greetings, Your Highness.

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:13.720
Your Highness,

00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:15.560
after repeated calculations,

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:16.920
we found Ye Xiyan's birth chart

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:19.160
aligns with prophecies of chaos.

00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:21.020
Not suitable to be a secondary consort.

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:27.040
You also analyzed my own fate,

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:28.880
calling me an ominous person.

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:30.560
Perfectly matched then.

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:33.920
The Princess Consort has arrived.

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:40.280
Your Highness, will you

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:42.800
prioritize a woman
over the nation's safety?

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:46.640
What virtue do I possess

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:49.560
to influence state affairs?

00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:56.600
Assassinating the Duke,

00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:58.080
and plunging the nation into chaos.

00:09:59.160 --> 00:09:59.760
Ye Xiyan.

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:00.360
Kneel!

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:02.000
Do you recognize this man?

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:07.480
I've never seen him.

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:10.640
What about this?

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:25.920
That's something I lost.

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:31.800
How strange that your lost item

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:34.800
ended up with Nanxing
from Meixiang House?

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:36.600
Witnesses reported

00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:38.640
you met her yesterday.

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:42.160
Nanxing and I are friends
from Meixiang House.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.280
Private gatherings are common for us.

00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:47.200
After my sister-in-law's death,

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:50.240
my brother deliberately
kept his movements secret.

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:51.760
He rarely went out.

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:53.560
The assassin has confessed

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:55.960
that you colluded with Nanxing

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:58.400
to lure the Duke to Meixiang House

00:10:58.400 --> 00:10:59.680
for an ambush.

00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:02.280
That shameless Nanxing

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:05.000
had already packed her valuables

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:06.400
for escaping

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:07.520
during the chaos.

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:10.200
With strict security in the capital,

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:12.880
how could she vanish

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:14.600
without your coordination?

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:16.600
If I wanted to assassinate the Duke,

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:18.440
would I be foolish enough

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:20.360
to leave so many clues?

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:34.360
Today is my secondary consort's
investiture banquet.

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:37.520
Must you all act this way?

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:40.000
Your Highness,

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:42.440
Ye Xiyan caused my mother's death.

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:44.040
Now she tries to kill my father.

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:46.320
Will you still protect her,

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:48.720
showing no regard for our marital bonds

00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:51.440
and favoring a concubine
over your lawful wife?

00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:54.640
Your Highness.

00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:57.312
King You deceived nobles with beacon

00:11:57.760 --> 00:11:59.120
to amuse Baosi.

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:00.680
King Zhou

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:02.440
heeded Daji's words

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:03.600
to slaughter loyal officials.

00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:04.760
Emperor Xuanzong's

00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:05.880
exclusive favor for Consort Yang

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:06.920
sparked mutiny.

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:09.360
Now,

00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:11.400
for this woman's sake,

00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:12.960
you would abandon the Duke's Mansion

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:14.800
and the Western Army.

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:16.880
Isn't that prove she's a demon?

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:20.640
By the Empress Dowager's decree,

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:22.280
Ye Xiyan's birth chart is inauspicious.

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:24.480
She implores you
to prioritize the realm.

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:26.080
Don't endanger the court

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:27.520
for a demoness.

00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:42.840
King You was tyrannical.

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:45.680
King Zhou was virtueless.

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:48.400
Emperor Xuanzong was excessive.

00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:49.880
And you

00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:51.960
are incompetent.

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:54.040
What did you say?

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:03.240
How dare you overstep your station?

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:10.360
If you want to impose a crime,

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:11.920
there's no lack of pretext.

00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:15.480
This country is governed by men.

00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:17.200
Its ruin also comes from men.

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:19.440
But the blame and disgrace

00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:21.640
are all shouldered by women.

00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:24.240
How absurd!

00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:36.800
Your Highness,

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:37.560
we can't delay.

00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:38.720
The optimal time

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:39.680
is at midnight tonight.

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:40.864
Burn the demoness.

00:13:40.864 --> 00:13:41.760
Reduce her to ashes.

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:42.720
Otherwise,

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:44.240
the realm will descend into chaos.

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:44.992
Exactly.

00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:14.800
Your Highness.

00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:17.800
The Western Army is about to rebel.

00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:19.320
Your Highness.

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:21.320
Your Highness,

00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:23.240
the Western Army remains
armed and vigilant,

00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:24.448
showing intent to attack.

00:14:24.448 --> 00:14:25.160
Your Highness.

00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:27.080
Commoners demand you

00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:27.840
kill the demoness.

00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:28.448
End the mutiny.

00:14:28.448 --> 00:14:29.008
Your Highness.

00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:31.040
Empress Dowager is furious.

00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:32.256
She's summoned officials.

00:14:38.624 --> 00:14:40.026
Send Consort Ye out of the capital.

00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:43.200
I can't leave.

00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:46.320
Ye Xiyan,

00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:48.560
if you wish to stay with me,

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:50.160
once this is resolved,

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:51.520
I'll bring you back.

00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:01.360
Now,

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:02.560
I represent you.

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:04.120
If I retreat,

00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:06.200
you will lose ground in this war

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:07.480
against the Empress Dowager

00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:08.520
and the Duke.

00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:10.760
Your political authority

00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:11.800
and power

00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:13.520
will be utterly destroyed.

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:23.000
You underestimate me greatly.

00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:27.160
I was never meant to be

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:28.640
among those you must protect.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.400
As a courtesan,

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:34.120
becoming your consort
was fortune enough.

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:37.240
I won't burden you further.

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:55.160
Your Highness.

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:03.920
Step aside.

00:16:05.792 --> 00:16:07.424
We'll follow you through life and death.

00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:11.080
If you insist on this course,

00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:13.160
you must trample our corpses first.

00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:15.680
- Please trample our corpses first.
- Please trample our corpses first.
