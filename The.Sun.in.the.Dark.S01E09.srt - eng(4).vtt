the Immortal Lord?

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.460
I'm sorry for my child.

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:55.819
Let the Three Realms know

00:02:56.419 --> 00:02:58.060
she saved everyone.

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:12.020
Jibai,

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:14.300
will you become sword crystal

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.479
and follow me?

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:16.900
I will.

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:42.379
Look what we found!

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:43.979
What's this?

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:47.300
The legendary Divine Maiden's residence?

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:51.139
- Let us in!
- Divine Maiden!

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:53.300
- Come out!
- Divine Maiden, come out!

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:55.319
Divine Maiden, show up!

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:57.419
This is the Divine Maiden?

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:59.659
She looks just like us.

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.180
Come closer, Divine Maiden.

00:04:01.219 --> 00:04:02.460
Let us see you.

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:04.740
Yes! Let us see you!

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:08.300
- Divine Maiden, come!
- Play with us!

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:14.819
Come.

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:23.779
Come.

00:04:27.579 --> 00:04:28.699
Mother, what are you doing?

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:30.100
I want to see the Divine Maiden!

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:30.740
Nonsense!

00:04:30.939 --> 00:04:31.939
She's no Divine Maiden.

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:33.180
She's cursed.

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:34.300
Within her

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:36.379
dwells the most evil, Night Deity.

00:04:36.459 --> 00:04:38.459
Anyone she touches dies.

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:39.379
If you want to live,

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:40.139
come with me now.

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:42.420
- Mother.
- Hurry!

00:04:42.899 --> 00:04:43.500
Come quickly!

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:44.620
Let's leave this place.

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:45.459
Never come again.

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:01.579
So this is the origin

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:03.139
of the deity's vessel.

00:05:05.339 --> 00:05:06.420
Master said before

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:09.500
the Huiyue Abode imprisoned the deity.

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:15.019
So it was her.

00:05:23.939 --> 00:05:24.500
Who is it?

00:05:24.899 --> 00:05:27.379
That's the little beast
containing the Night Deity!

00:05:27.379 --> 00:05:28.860
She caused my father's death!

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.980
I'll kill her

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:31.060
to avenge my father!

00:05:31.459 --> 00:05:33.339
The Night Deity is our enemy!

00:05:33.339 --> 00:05:34.180
Kill her!

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:35.019
Filthy beast!

00:05:35.019 --> 00:05:35.980
Kill her!

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:37.100
You wretched creature!

00:05:37.259 --> 00:05:38.699
- Kill her!
- Crush you!

00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:39.540
Kill her!

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:40.660
Smash you!

00:05:40.899 --> 00:05:41.740
Die!

00:05:43.019 --> 00:05:44.500
- Kill her!
- You vile thing!

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:47.220
Her blood is venomous.

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:49.579
Staying here risks our lives.

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:50.500
Let's go.

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:52.019
- Go!
- Quickly!

00:06:05.536 --> 00:06:08.787
(Huiyue Abode)

00:06:13.819 --> 00:06:15.660
(Since I bring misfortune,)

00:06:18.259 --> 00:06:19.420
(perhaps...)

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:34.600
(What will finally work?)

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:38.639
(This time, it'll work.)

00:06:41.879 --> 00:06:42.920
(With so much poison,)

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.160
(surely this will suffice.)

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:52.959
Why am I still alive?

00:06:53.319 --> 00:06:54.759
Not working, either.

00:06:56.639 --> 00:06:58.120
(160 attempts now.)

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:01.000
(Seems I'll never succeed.)

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:07.439
Why?

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:15.160
Wan Guchen,

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:16.519
stop looking around.

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:18.040
See something forbidden,

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:19.199
and you'll be punished.

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:20.240
Okay.

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:23.480
What happened to her?

00:07:25.519 --> 00:07:26.240
Let's save her!

00:07:28.279 --> 00:07:30.560
Do you even know who she is?
Rushing so quickly.

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:32.600
The Night Deity's sealed within her.

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:34.720
Her blood is venomous.

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:37.199
Just leave it there.

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:38.800
Don't meddle further.

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:42.439
Even with the Night Deity sealed inside,

00:07:42.959 --> 00:07:44.639
she's done nothing wrong.

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:46.160
What if

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:48.439
she dies like this?

00:07:48.439 --> 00:07:50.560
Relax. She won't die.

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:52.800
Just leave it there.

00:07:53.279 --> 00:07:53.959
Go.

00:08:49.879 --> 00:08:51.600
I'm still alive.

00:08:56.799 --> 00:08:58.720
Someone bandaged me?

00:09:05.279 --> 00:09:06.039
How are you doing?

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:07.159
Feeling better?

00:09:07.919 --> 00:09:08.600
Who are you?

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:11.159
Did you bandage my wound?

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:13.000
Yes.

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:15.279
I noticed the wound on your wrist,

00:09:15.679 --> 00:09:17.080
so I dressed it for you.

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:20.919
I'm a junior disciple
assigned to bring you meals.

00:09:21.399 --> 00:09:22.360
My name is Wan Guchen.

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:24.200
You can call me Chen.

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:26.759
Wan Guchen.

00:09:27.639 --> 00:09:29.000
Meal delivery.

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:30.919
No wonder you could enter.

00:09:32.039 --> 00:09:33.360
Didn't they tell you

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:34.960
about my identity?

00:09:35.639 --> 00:09:37.080
They gave a general explanation.

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:38.600
Since you know who I am,

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:39.960
why did you save me?

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.879
Because you're someone
I've longed to meet.

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:45.919
Now that I've finally seen you today,

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:47.600
how could I bear

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:49.519
to leave you bleeding alone?

00:09:54.639 --> 00:09:56.320
Many are curious about me.

00:09:56.519 --> 00:09:58.360
Plenty come to gawk at my misery.

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:00.480
You're like them.

00:10:02.639 --> 00:10:04.240
Seems you're recovering well.

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:06.200
Better eat now.

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:07.759
Though it's gone cold,

00:10:08.279 --> 00:10:11.159
it'll help maintain your strength.

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:15.759
(So overly attentive.)

00:10:16.519 --> 00:10:18.200
(Could he have poisoned the food?)

00:10:20.399 --> 00:10:22.000
(First using bandaging as a pretext)

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:23.799
(to lower my guard,)

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:26.080
(and then using the chance to kill me?)

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:30.679
Though this pain's intense,

00:10:31.159 --> 00:10:31.960
I can eat.

00:10:33.279 --> 00:10:34.000
Let me try.

00:10:55.159 --> 00:10:57.080
You didn't poison the food?

00:10:57.879 --> 00:11:00.120
Why would I poison you?

00:11:00.799 --> 00:11:01.559
I told you

00:11:01.799 --> 00:11:03.360
you were someone I wanted to meet.

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:05.320
Don't worry.

00:11:05.519 --> 00:11:06.919
I will never harm you.

00:11:09.379 --> 00:11:10.820
I've eaten.

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:12.059
We've talked enough.

00:11:12.879 --> 00:11:14.000
Will you leave now?

00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:15.460
You're right.

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:16.759
It's getting late.

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:17.799
I should head back now.

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:19.940
If they can't find me soon,

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:20.799
there'll be nagging.

00:11:21.259 --> 00:11:21.940
I'm leaving.

00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:23.179
See you tomorrow.

00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:33.259
All that "I won't hurt you" talk

00:11:33.379 --> 00:11:34.259
is just lies.

00:11:37.159 --> 00:11:38.320
Within days,

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:40.639
your true nature will show.

00:11:59.159 --> 00:12:00.639
Just as expected, a fraud.

00:12:07.259 --> 00:12:09.120
Here, fresh-picked fruits.

If you keep this insincere act up,

00:12:14.639 --> 00:12:15.720
I won't eat your food.

00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:17.179
I'll leave them here.

00:12:17.379 --> 00:12:18.980
Eat whenever you wish.

00:13:45.079 --> 00:13:47.936
♪But shattered mirrors never mend♪

00:13:47.936 --> 00:13:54.848
♪I don't know
whether to forget or remember♪

00:13:54.848 --> 00:13:58.528
♪Borrowing a full moon from heaven♪

00:13:58.937 --> 00:14:01.920
♪Cradling moonlight like broken glass♪

♪Cloaked in moonlight,

00:14:26.399 --> 00:14:28.159
Others refuse this duty

00:14:28.639 --> 00:14:29.440
and feel terrified.

00:14:30.559 --> 00:14:31.519
But you're different,

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:34.080
never missing a day in years.

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:36.679
You're pure-hearted,

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:39.080
not dangerous as they claim.

00:14:40.799 --> 00:14:41.759
This person

00:14:43.559 --> 00:14:44.799
looks exactly like me.

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:49.960
She lived at the Huiyue Abode too.

00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:57.919
(Why?)

00:14:58.639 --> 00:15:00.279
(Her memories flood my mind.)

00:15:01.039 --> 00:15:02.120
(This agony...)

00:15:03.399 --> 00:15:04.240
(This sorrow...)

00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:10.759
If you haven't eaten,

00:15:12.679 --> 00:15:13.879
stay and join me.

00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:18.559
I didn't bring more utensils.

00:15:20.159 --> 00:15:21.200
Then keep me company.

00:15:41.399 --> 00:15:43.360
How many junior disciples are there?

00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:45.919
Over 300.

00:15:47.279 --> 00:15:49.000
What are your daily duties?

00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:50.840
Typically,

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:52.519
we practice immortal arts.

00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:55.039
But exceptions like me

00:15:55.039 --> 00:15:56.919
sweep palace floors,

00:15:57.240 --> 00:15:58.919
water plants, burn trash,

00:15:59.159 --> 00:16:01.559
and wash clothes for immortals.

00:16:03.399 --> 00:16:04.720
So you

00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:06.759
encounter diverse people daily.

00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:07.519
Yeah.

00:16:08.679 --> 00:16:09.639
Tell me more.

00:16:11.059 --> 00:16:12.600
I've been confined here for years,

00:16:13.059 --> 00:16:14.100
knowing nothing.

00:16:17.039 --> 00:16:18.279
I'll share something relevant.

00:16:18.679 --> 00:16:19.159
Alright.

00:16:20.639 --> 00:16:22.679
At the recent Divine Sword trials,

00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:24.440
Immortal Zili won first place.

00:16:25.399 --> 00:16:27.039
But the sword didn't accept him.

00:16:27.759 --> 00:16:29.000
The Immortal Lord's vexed.

00:16:29.759 --> 00:16:32.840
Now, they want to seek
a new Sword Master to protect you.

00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:35.720
Protect me?

00:16:35.919 --> 00:16:36.399
Yeah.

00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:39.320
Never mind.

00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:43.960
If I must have a guardian,

00:16:46.639 --> 00:16:48.799
you'd be a decent candidate.

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:54.120
Me?

00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:57.360
Just kidding.

00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:00.039
You're just a low-ranking disciple.

00:17:04.319 --> 00:17:04.839
True enough.

00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:13.000
The world beyond...

00:17:21.359 --> 00:17:23.039
I wish I could see it.

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:26.559
If you truly want to go,

00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:28.400
I can help you.

00:17:30.039 --> 00:17:31.119
How can you help me?

00:17:31.839 --> 00:17:33.960
This place is surrounded by spells.

00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:36.279
You come and go using your tokens.

00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:37.119
But I can't.

00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:39.880
Unless

00:17:40.359 --> 00:17:41.720
that person comes here personally,

00:17:42.559 --> 00:17:44.319
none of you can take me out.

00:17:45.599 --> 00:17:46.319
Let me tell you.

00:17:47.119 --> 00:17:49.200
My ancestors received
favors from rabbit spirits.

00:17:49.759 --> 00:17:51.839
They taught me
the Three-Burrow spatial technique.

00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:53.359
I can't do other magic,

00:17:53.519 --> 00:17:55.079
but I've mastered this since childhood.

00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:56.799
I can teach it to you.

00:17:57.680 --> 00:17:58.279
Really?

00:17:58.680 --> 00:17:59.119
Truly.

00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:05.720
But within me...

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:09.480
Never mind.

00:18:10.279 --> 00:18:12.119
It might cause trouble.

00:18:16.799 --> 00:18:17.440
I have an idea.

00:18:30.519 --> 00:18:31.039
Follow me.

00:18:38.319 --> 00:18:40.480
So this is the magnificent Nine Heavens.

00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:41.720
Of course.

00:18:42.359 --> 00:18:44.680
Countless cultivators dream of
reaching this sacred place.

00:18:48.319 --> 00:18:49.240
Immortal Xiyuan.

00:18:55.559 --> 00:18:56.559
You look

00:18:57.039 --> 00:18:59.119
so familiar.

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:04.160
What's your name?

00:19:07.799 --> 00:19:08.759
She's my younger sister.

00:19:09.279 --> 00:19:09.920
Named...

00:19:11.079 --> 00:19:11.799
Qi.

00:19:12.519 --> 00:19:13.440
Born prematurely,

00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:14.440
she cannot speak.

00:19:15.119 --> 00:19:16.279
She's a new disciple here.

00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:17.839
You couldn't have met her before.

00:19:21.759 --> 00:19:23.559
I must be mistaken.

00:19:30.519 --> 00:19:31.799
Too many immortals here.

00:19:32.039 --> 00:19:33.559
Let's find a quieter area.

00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:34.319
Yeah.

00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:34.799
Go.

00:19:40.799 --> 00:19:42.000
So beautiful!

00:19:43.319 --> 00:19:45.079
The outside world is breathtaking.

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:48.319
Tell me whenever you want to come out.

00:19:49.319 --> 00:19:50.400
I'll take you out.

00:20:02.839 --> 00:20:03.440
Thank you.

00:20:06.079 --> 00:20:07.240
Without you,

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:09.720
I'd never see
such beauty in my lifetime.

00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:13.319
You're welcome.

00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:33.000
I wonder what Wan Guchen will think

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:34.559
if he sees me like this.

00:20:44.319 --> 00:20:44.920
Stop!

00:20:46.799 --> 00:20:48.480
Where's the usual meal deliverer?

00:20:48.519 --> 00:20:49.319
Why isn't he here?

00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:50.680
I don't know.

00:20:51.039 --> 00:20:52.759
We were just assigned here temporarily.

00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:54.240
Hurry!

00:20:56.319 --> 00:20:56.720
No.

00:20:57.559 --> 00:20:58.440
I need to find him.

00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:00.799
Wan Guchen!

00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:02.200
Wan Guchen!

00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:09.359
Wan Guchen!

00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:10.759
Wan Guchen!

00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:16.279
What happened?

00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:18.119
How did you get hurt?

00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:20.000
I'm sorry.

00:21:22.319 --> 00:21:23.880
I didn't bring your meal today.

00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:25.720
Why say that?

00:21:26.079 --> 00:21:27.200
Don't apologize.

00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:30.039
Who gave you these injuries?

00:21:30.279 --> 00:21:31.200
Who harmed you?

00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:39.000
They're still here?

00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:40.440
Hide now!

00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:41.319
Now!

00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:42.640
Now that I'm here,

00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:44.319
I won't back down.

00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:46.680
Wan Guchen,

00:21:47.519 --> 00:21:49.440
no wonder you've been acting strange.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.400
I caught you red-handed.

00:21:52.039 --> 00:21:53.880
What lowly maid is this?

00:21:54.279 --> 00:21:55.880
Consorting with you?

00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:57.279
Makes sense.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.519
Lowly people

00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:02.119
would do such shameless things.

00:22:02.759 --> 00:22:03.359
Wan Zerui,

00:22:03.839 --> 00:22:04.519
shut your mouth.

00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:07.680
Bully me all you want,

00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:10.119
but I won't let you insult her!

00:22:11.599 --> 00:22:12.559
Wan Zerui?

00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:14.119
He's your...

00:22:14.119 --> 00:22:15.960
Who do you think you are?

00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:17.160
Speaking to me like this?

00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:19.640
You're a cursed disaster from birth.

00:22:19.799 --> 00:22:21.319
If not for our grandfather's mercy,

00:22:21.839 --> 00:22:23.279
how could you be sent here

00:22:23.599 --> 00:22:24.799
for cultivation with me?

00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:28.480
If you're his family,

00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:29.960
why treat him so cruelly?

00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:30.960
Pah!

00:22:32.079 --> 00:22:34.559
He's the shame
of our Wanfeng royal family!

00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:36.920
Attack!

00:22:57.880 --> 00:22:58.519
It's alright.

00:22:58.819 --> 00:22:59.619
They've left.

00:23:05.359 --> 00:23:07.119
You're the first to stand up for me.

00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:10.279
Thank you.

00:23:14.559 --> 00:23:15.359
Don't mention it.

00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:18.000
Consider it repayment
for bringing me meals.

00:23:19.839 --> 00:23:20.519
But tell me,

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.400
if they're your family,

00:23:22.799 --> 00:23:24.000
why treat you so harshly?

00:23:24.559 --> 00:23:25.200
Since childhood,

00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:26.960
I've been seen

00:23:28.359 --> 00:23:29.559
as an ill omen in their eyes.

00:23:30.359 --> 00:23:30.920
Your Majesty,

00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:34.359
our Wanfeng Kingdom
has never suffered Night Clan invasions.

00:23:34.799 --> 00:23:36.680
As soon as the little prince was born,

00:23:36.799 --> 00:23:37.839
the Night Clan attacked,

00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:42.200
costing us
our Crown Prince and Princess!

00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:45.160
This... this is an evil portent!

00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:46.119
- Yes!
- Yes!

00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:47.799
Misfortune struck
the moment he was born.

00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:49.240
A true harbinger of doom!

00:23:49.759 --> 00:23:51.079
I planted fear within him.

00:23:51.799 --> 00:23:53.559
No matter his future status,

00:23:53.759 --> 00:23:54.559
power,

00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:55.680
or location,

00:23:56.119 --> 00:23:57.359
he'll forever fear dogs.

00:23:57.720 --> 00:23:59.079
- Troublemaker!
- Menace!

00:24:00.319 --> 00:24:02.599
- Jinx!
- Nuisance! Pest!

00:24:03.039 --> 00:24:03.960
Scourge!

00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:05.000
You cursed wretch!

00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:07.440
So...

00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:11.480
your parents were killed
by the Night Clan.

00:24:15.119 --> 00:24:15.839
Wan Guchen,

00:24:18.079 --> 00:24:20.039
the Night Deity is sealed within me.

00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:22.400
Even so,

00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:25.000
don't you resent me at all?

00:24:29.359 --> 00:24:30.880
Since learning about you,

00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:33.119
knowing there's someone

00:24:34.079 --> 00:24:36.039
who shares my fate

00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:40.000
of being seen as cursed and cast aside,

00:24:40.799 --> 00:24:42.440
I've felt less alone.

00:24:43.559 --> 00:24:45.200
That's why I wanted to meet you.

00:24:46.079 --> 00:24:47.160
As for the Night Deity,

00:24:47.799 --> 00:24:48.920
that's not your fault.

00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:52.960
I won't shift hatred onto the innocent.

00:24:58.440 --> 00:24:59.160
It's okay.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.160
I'll protect you from now on.

00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:03.279
No one will hurt you again.

00:25:11.759 --> 00:25:13.960
This is the only thing
my mother left me.

00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:17.359
When scared,

00:25:17.759 --> 00:25:19.079
I feel her watching over me.

00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:23.759
I want you to have it.

00:25:24.279 --> 00:25:24.799
This way,

00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:26.319
even when I'm gone,

00:25:26.799 --> 00:25:28.039
it'll keep you safe.

00:25:40.559 --> 00:25:42.000
I'll treasure it always.

00:25:43.359 --> 00:25:43.839
Yeah.

00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:52.359
Don't let others see you here.

00:25:52.799 --> 00:25:53.599
Go back now.

00:25:54.279 --> 00:25:55.480
I'll visit when healed.

00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:01.720
Promise?

00:26:02.799 --> 00:26:03.359
Yeah.

00:27:36.519 --> 00:27:37.400
You're here.

00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:39.079
You've waited long?

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:41.759
Not at all.

00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:44.279
I have a gift for you.

00:27:51.359 --> 00:27:51.720
Come.

00:27:53.079 --> 00:27:53.960
Let's go somewhere.

00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:55.839
Okay.

00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:19.079
It's beautiful!

00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:20.640
How did you do this?

00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:29.279
You said

00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:31.440
your blood made flowers wither.

00:28:32.359 --> 00:28:34.079
I learned a new spell secretly.

00:28:34.839 --> 00:28:37.000
Still trying to master it.

00:28:38.079 --> 00:28:39.039
It can't sustain long.

00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:43.119
I love it.

00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:48.279
Make flowers for me often.

00:28:49.519 --> 00:28:50.119
I'll make them

00:28:50.839 --> 00:28:51.680
if you want.

00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:53.039
Deal.

00:29:02.359 --> 00:29:03.000
Bai Yixi!

00:29:03.519 --> 00:29:04.759
You sneaked out!

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:06.039
Violating immortal laws!

00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:10.119
So you really are that monster.

00:29:10.519 --> 00:29:12.240
No wonder you consort together.

00:29:12.839 --> 00:29:15.799
Monster pairing with the jinx.

00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:19.039
How can you say that?

00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:21.359
Staying here for over a decade,

00:29:21.599 --> 00:29:22.960
I've never done any wrongdoings

00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:24.640
and never harmed anyone.

00:29:25.839 --> 00:29:26.720
Don't you know

00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:28.759
you're the vessel
of the ancient evil deity?

00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:30.160
If you wander around

00:29:30.319 --> 00:29:32.119
and let the Night Deity
escape to wreak havoc,

00:29:32.119 --> 00:29:33.039
it'll be on you!

00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:35.240
I'm not the one to endanger the world,

00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:37.720
nor did I choose to be the vessel.

00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:41.319
Why must I bear this burden?

00:29:41.599 --> 00:29:43.559
How can you say
such heartless, selfish words?

00:29:44.119 --> 00:29:45.839
You lack compassion
or a sense of justice,

00:29:46.039 --> 00:29:47.359
betraying the lord's mercy.

00:29:48.039 --> 00:29:50.839
Since you'll endanger the Three Realms,

00:29:51.759 --> 00:29:52.759
we can't let you live.

00:30:01.599 --> 00:30:02.160
Chen.

00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:03.119
Are you alright?

00:30:11.359 --> 00:30:12.000
Yixi.
