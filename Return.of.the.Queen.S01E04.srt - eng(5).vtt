[Return of the Queen]

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.200
[Episode 4]

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:46.240
Kid,

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.940
I'll give you one more chance.

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:07.600
Look me in the eyes

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:09.560
and repeat

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:11.160
what you just said.

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:14.780
What do you want to hear...

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:16.640
sister?

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.900
Who are you calling "sister"?

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.620
Say it a few more times.

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.840
Let me hear it.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.660
Wasn't that what you taught me

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:36.640
in the study that day?

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:39.680
I taught you,

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.010
and you learned it well?

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.420
I didn't expect you

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.090
to be such a good boy.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:52.680
Too bad.

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:54.840
In this lifetime,

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:55.880
I will always be a Ye,

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:56.840
never a Lu.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.680
Lu Siyue

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:58.920
is your dear sister.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.460
As for you and me...

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.000
Stay away from me.

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:07.800
Ye Haimeng!

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:14.400
Have you forgotten

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.640
all the warnings I gave you?

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.040
I told you long ago that

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.240
if you dared to approach my son again...

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:22.840
Haimeng.

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:35.820
You don't remember me?

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:38.520
No, that's not it.

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:41.120
I understand

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.560
that this situation is

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.120
quite difficult for you.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.920
Although

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:46.760
you and Sinan

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.400
used to call me "Dad,"

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:49.840
Sinan is

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.480
no longer with us.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.360
If you're willing,

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:54.040
you can still call me

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.000
Uncle Lu, like you did

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.960
when your father and I worked together

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:57.200
back then.

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:58.370
Please, sit.

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:05.520
A few days ago,

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:06.980
they told me you were back.

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.170
I couldn't believe it at first.

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.560
After all, it's been 3 years,

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.800
and you've been completely out of touch.

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.360
I sent people everywhere to look for you,

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:16.640
but they found nothing.

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:17.839
I thought I would

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:20.200
never see you again in this lifetime.

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:21.320
Even now,

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:22.840
I often recall

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.240
the first time Sinan brought you

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.040
to meet me at the hotel.

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:29.380
[Gan Jiang 12]

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:30.480
Sinan.

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.120
[Gan Jiang 12]

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.920
What's wrong?

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.000
I'm a bit scared.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.980
I feel uneasy about this.

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:36.480
[Gan Jiang 12]

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:37.740
What are you afraid of?

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:39.280
What if

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.080
your father doesn't like me

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.480
and disapproves

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:42.760
of our relationship?

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:44.350
[Gan Jiang 12]

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:46.560
How could that be?

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.360
My dad and your father are
business partners.

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:50.760
He's watched you grow up.

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.880
And you're sensible and gentle.

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:54.460
He couldn't ask for
a better daughter-in-law.

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:54.800
[Gan Jiang 12]

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:55.560
Relax.

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:57.720
You don't need to
worry about anything else.

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:58.680
Just trust me.

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:02.970
Let's go.

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:11.720
Dad.

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:14.320
I've brought her with me.

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:16.840
Hello, Uncle Lu.

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:20.640
Sinan,

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:22.280
no wonder you've turned down

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.520
all the blind dates

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:24.920
Auntie Du set up for you.

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:25.840
Turns out

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:28.440
you've secretly fallen for Haimeng
all along.

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:30.800
Dad,

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.000
please stop talking about blind dates.

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.240
If Auntie Du knew

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.600
that the girl you love is

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.530
the only daughter of the Ye family,

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:40.440
she wouldn't set up
any blind dates for you.

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:42.200
She would be pushing you two

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.520
to get married right away.

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:44.080
Dad.

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:45.560
Haimeng,

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:47.330
I hope you don't mind

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:49.440
joining our Lu family.

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:05.730
It's such a tragedy that...

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:08.520
my poor son

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:09.800
is gone.

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:19.000
Haimeng,

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:21.160
for the past 3 years,

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:22.440
where have you been,

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:24.040
and what have you been doing?

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:25.680
Why, for 3 whole years,

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:26.960
did you not contact us?

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:28.760
During these 3 years,

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:31.500
I narrowly escaped death time and again.

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:33.850
It's all thanks to Sinan

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:35.520
that I'm alive today.

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:38.159
Once I sort everything out

00:06:38.159 --> 00:06:39.360
between him and me

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:41.280
and between the Ye family
and the Lu family,

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:43.280
I will find an appropriate public occasion

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:45.280
to reveal everything that happened

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:46.520
in these 3 years.

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:51.120
Okay.

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:52.920
Since you don't want to talk about it,

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:53.960
I won't force you.

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:56.010
As an elder of the Lu family,

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:57.520
I cannot mistreat you.

00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:59.360
This Cloud Manor

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:01.960
was originally purchased by
both our families

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:03.040
as a wedding home

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:04.600
for you and Sinan.

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:05.800
Give me a few weeks.

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.360
I'll have them clean

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:08.600
the manor until it's spotless

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:09.860
and hand it over to you.

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:12.130
I'll take everyone in my family

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:14.480
and move to the villa in the suburbs.

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:19.240
As for Mare Nubium...

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:21.320
when

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:22.440
such a big incident happened

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:23.960
to you and Sinan back then,

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:25.200
I took it upon myself

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:26.560
to have Jiang Lin and Siyue

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:27.560
manage it on your behalf.

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:28.760
Now that you're back,

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:30.840
I'll have them hand it all over to you

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:32.240
as soon as possible.

00:07:34.159 --> 00:07:35.420
Are you really going to

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:37.120
return Mare Nubium to me?

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:38.400
It must be.

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:40.240
Because this company

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:41.440
was your parents'

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:43.120
life's work,

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:44.280
wasn't it?

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:49.159
If it weren't for the huge incident

00:07:49.159 --> 00:07:51.320
that happened to you and Sinan back then,

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:52.520
our two families—the Ye and Lu families—

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:54.120
should have formed

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:55.280
a powerful alliance.

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:57.210
Our position in the business world

00:07:57.880 --> 00:07:58.920
would be

00:07:59.159 --> 00:08:00.800
much stronger today.

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:05.760
If you really can arrange

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:07.600
to return Mare Nubium and Cloud Manor

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:08.560
to me,

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:09.280
I'll be...

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:12.400
eternally grateful.

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:14.600
What are you saying, silly child?

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:16.000
We should be

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.600
the ones apologizing to you.

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:19.960
Now, if anything happens,

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:20.840
or anyone dares to make things difficult

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:22.200
for you in this family,

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:23.120
just tell me.

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:24.620
As long as I'm here,

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:26.500
I promise you won't suffer

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:28.280
even the slightest grievance.

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:33.280
In 2 days,

00:08:34.679 --> 00:08:36.280
it'll be my 60th birthday.

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:38.039
I've been thinking of

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:39.280
hosting

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:40.360
a family banquet here.

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:41.490
During the banquet,

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:44.039
you can also make an announcement

00:08:44.039 --> 00:08:44.920
about Sinan

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:45.920
to everyone.

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:47.520
After the banquet,

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:49.840
we'll return everything

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:52.080
that rightfully belongs to you.

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:01.320
Having second thoughts?

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:02.360
No.

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:05.240
I just feel that something's off.

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:07.300
Don't let a small gesture of kindness

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:09.160
fool you into trusting someone

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:11.020
who has never revealed his cards.

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:14.280
In business,

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:15.920
Lu Changdong and my father worked together

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:17.160
for over a decade.

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:18.930
When profit is at stake,

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:21.410
you choose to believe in human nature?

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:31.420
Have you found anything about Tianyang?

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:33.640
After that car accident last time,

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:34.880
they must have noticed

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:35.840
our activities.

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:38.360
We need to rescue my mother

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:40.360
before we alert them.

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:24.120
Tonight,

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:25.240
many people will attend Lu Changdong's

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:26.570
60th birthday banquet.

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:27.560
My second uncle's family

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:28.280
will also be there.

00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:29.400
If I see them,

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:30.280
I'll ask about the shares

00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:32.120
they've been holding on my mom's behalf.

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:32.720
We've found information

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:33.720
about Tianyang.

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:34.640
What?

00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:36.720
It turns out

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.200
what's on the note isn't "Tianyang"

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:39.130
but "Yang Tian."

00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:41.450
What do you mean?

00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:42.960
There's a large

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:44.200
retirement community in the suburbs.

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:45.160
Its official name

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:46.420
is "Yi Yang Tian Nian."

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:49.000
We traced through layers of ownership
and shell companies

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.120
and finally found

00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:51.720
a nominee shareholder.

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:53.320
She's the wife of

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:54.980
a Changlu Group board member.

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:56.720
A retirement community?

00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:59.930
Changlu Group's people hold shares in it?

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.200
It's common practice

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:03.640
for hidden shareholders
to use their wives as proxy holders.

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:04.800
Plus, there are multiple layers

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:06.960
and changes
in corporate equity structures.

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:08.480
And Changlu Capital Group

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:10.740
is a company that started in real estate.

00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:11.680
All that evidence

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:12.680
clearly proves

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:14.640
that the retirement community

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:15.560
is one of the businesses

00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:16.890
owned by Changlu Group.

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:18.240
And then?

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:19.240
Does that mean...

00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:20.360
Within that community,

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:21.480
there's a very high-end,

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:23.240
very secretive medical center.

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:25.000
It means that after your accident,

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.480
your mother has very likely been

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:27.240
hidden in

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:28.440
that medical center.

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:38.880
Notify Tan Xin

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:40.680
to immediately dig up all information

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:41.640
about the shareholders

00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:43.000
and actual controllers
behind that medical center

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.320
and investigate Changlu Group thoroughly.

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:45.600
By any means necessary,

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:46.640
get the list

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:47.080
of all patients—

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:48.320
age, blood type,

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:50.480
symptoms, medical conditions—
and cross-check everything.

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:51.080
We must

00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:52.320
find my mother.

00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:57.330
Haimeng.

00:11:58.320 --> 00:11:59.380
It's been too long.

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:01.160
We saw each other

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:02.560
at my funeral that day.

00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:03.640
But with everything happening that day,

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:04.560
I really didn't have time

00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:05.760
to come over and talk to you.

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:06.880
Later, I heard

00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:08.010
you'd moved in here.

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:09.240
I actually came once,

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:10.480
but I still didn't get to see you.

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:11.120
I know.

00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:12.760
Ke told me about it.

00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:14.570
So that's what you call her.

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:15.760
Well...

00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:17.840
is she a new friend of yours?

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:19.240
I remember when we were little,

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:19.680
I never

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:20.960
saw her around you.

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:21.820
How did you two meet?

00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:22.040
Or...

00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:23.500
You're interested in her?

00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:26.040
No.

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:27.800
I'm just

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:28.960
a little curious about

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:30.220
the people around you.

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:32.120
Ye Bochen.

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:33.920
You're my cousin.

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:35.880
We grew up together.

00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:37.440
I know exactly

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:39.170
what's on your mind.

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:40.320
If you really knew

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:41.450
what I was thinking,

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:42.760
then you wouldn't have married

00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:43.800
Lu Sinan.

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:45.040
I remember warning you.

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:46.160
The Lu family is complicated—

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:47.440
parents and siblings

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:48.440
all have their own grudges.

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:49.280
Behind Changlu Group,

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:50.360
there's a great deal of capital—

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:51.360
various investors,

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:52.000
shareholders,

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:52.680
and board members,

00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:53.840
all tangled in interests.

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:55.160
It's much harder to control than

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:56.200
our Ye family and Mare Nubium.

00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:57.260
But do you remember

00:12:58.240 --> 00:12:59.700
what you told me back then?

00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:03.360
I forgot.

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:04.800
You said

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:05.840
you believed

00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:07.480
Sinan truly loved you.

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:09.600
Cousin,

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:10.040
don't you think

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:11.280
what you're saying right now

00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:12.040
is rather offensive?

00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:12.920
On the contrary, I think

00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:13.920
I should have had

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:16.120
this conversation with you 3 years ago.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.000
Then you wouldn't have experienced

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.040
such a terrible accident

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:21.240
and suffered so much.

00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:25.560
I know.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.730
Whether it was back then or now,

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:29.040
in such a complex situation

00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:29.900
with our family

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.480
and the Lu family,

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:32.640
you've always been

00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:34.440
the one who truly cared about me.

00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:36.940
But I couldn't see you,

00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:39.160
because I was afraid that once I saw you,

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:40.880
I'd lose my courage to fight.

00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:42.120
Not everyone

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:43.640
in this world is like you—

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:45.560
able to hide their wounds

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:46.600
and forgive everyone,

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:47.640
even after being hurt

00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:48.640
and betrayed.

00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:50.800
Not everyone

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:51.960
deserves forgiveness.

00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:53.080
Not everything

00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:54.280
is worth tolerating.

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:55.200
I must take back

00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:56.930
everything that belongs to me.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:57.730
As for you...

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:03.200
Whether you choose to be my friend
or my enemy,

00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:03.800
let me know

00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:06.000
once you've decided,

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:19.760
Haimeng.

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:22.000
Where are you going?

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:23.680
Tonight,

00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:24.160
I might...

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:25.120
Tonight is

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:26.580
my 60th birthday banquet.

00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:27.480
You're not going to tell me

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:28.440
that you're going out now

00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:29.280
to meet someone

00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:30.800
more important than me, are you?

00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:31.440
I...

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:32.160
I want to formally

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:33.080
introduce you to

00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:34.520
the shareholders and board members

00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:35.360
of Changlu Group,

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:36.400
who used to work

00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:37.760
with your parents.

00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:39.240
I hope

00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:40.680
our Changlu and your Mare Nubium

00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:41.600
can still maintain

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:42.800
the same strong cooperation

00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:43.880
as

00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:45.000
when your parents were here.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.000
Tonight,

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.520
you can't go anywhere.

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:50.700
The board members of Changlu Capital...

00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:51.480
Maybe

00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:52.800
I can get some clues

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:54.360
about Mom from them.

00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:03.160
Today

00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:04.560
is my 60th birthday.

00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:06.120
It's also

00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:07.560
my first time back

00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:08.640
after half a year of recuperation.

00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:09.560
All of you here

00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:11.360
are my family

00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:12.760
and my relatives.

00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:14.040
Everyone, please don't be reserved

00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:15.000
or stand on ceremony.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:15.840
In the future,

00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:17.000
I'll still need

00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:18.560
all of your support.

00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:19.400
Come on.

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:21.320
Let's raise our glasses.

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:22.720
Chairman, with you here at Changlu,

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:23.440
we're just

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:24.160
following your lead.

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:26.120
-Yes.
-Yes.

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:29.240
These past few years, Mare Nubium

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:30.970
has owed a lot to Changlu Group.

00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:32.200
With Chairman Lu's

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:33.560
help and support,
