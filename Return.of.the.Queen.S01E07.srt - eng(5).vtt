[Episode 7]

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.080
I just saw Jiang Lin

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.140
in the parking lot.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:43.920
I noticed he was holding

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:44.920
some documents.

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:46.360
They had my brother's name

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:47.360
and photo on them.

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:48.960
If I'm not mistaken,

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:49.840
he's probably filing

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.840
a death declaration for my brother.

Can you hear me?

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:01.480
I can hear you.

What's wrong with you?

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.960
Do you even know how to drive?

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:27.490
How could you just swerve
and brake like that?

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:32.720

came out with you.

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.780
But then...

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:40.079

you having any heart problems.

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:50.960
It must be competitive anxiety.

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.120
Competitive anxiety?

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.400
When I was competing overseas,

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:56.560
the pressure was overwhelming.

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.120
I haven't had an episode in a long time,

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.920
but today,

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.200
on my way to the archery club,

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:02.400
it suddenly...

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:08.200
Listen, Siyu.

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.320
Do as I say—

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:10.600
pull over to the side of the road,

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:10.960
okay?

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:12.480
Then take a few deep breaths.

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:13.320
Once you feel better,

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:14.120
drive back home,

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.040

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:15.840
Lin.

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:18.920
I don't think I can drive anymore.

00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:21.959
Then

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:24.280
I'll call for medical assistance,

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:25.200
so the hospital staff
can come pick you up,

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.640
okay?

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:26.680

That won't help.

Anxiety

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.720
is a neurosis

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.850
that shows up with physical symptoms.

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:35.040
The hospital won't find

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.600
any physiological indicators for it.

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:37.860

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:00.280

00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:14.880
One day, you'll be

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:16.240
the most accomplished among the Lu family.

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:17.680
You'll bring home

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:20.160
the most, the best,

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:22.240
the most dazzling championships.

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:23.120
I can do it.

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:24.400
I'll bring home

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:26.600
the most, the best,

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:28.810
the most dazzling championships.

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:32.720
Brother, I hit it!

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:33.880
I really hit the target!

00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:35.280
One day, I'll win championships.

00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:36.000
I can bring home many championships

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.080
for the Lu family.

00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:45.880
Actually, when I was little,

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:48.080
no one in my family

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:49.680
allowed me to learn archery.

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:50.960
Only my brother

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:52.970
firmly supported me all along.

00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:55.520
Even my studies abroad

00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:56.160
were all thanks to my brother

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:57.560
who constantly helped me.

00:12:57.560 --> 00:12:58.160
School,

00:12:58.480 --> 00:12:59.120
coach,

00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:00.160
accommodation—

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:00.800
everything was personally

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:01.920
arranged by him.

00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:03.880
My brother often told me

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:07.290
to bring back more championships,

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:08.360
so that

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:10.120
when people

00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:11.720
think of the Lu family,

00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:15.000
they wouldn't just think of
the Changlu Group,

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.260
but also the youngest son of the Lu family

00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:19.480
achieving outstanding results

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:22.800
on a bigger, broader stage.

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:25.280
Sinan.

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:30.930
Sinan, look.

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:33.720
I won an excellence award
in this competition.

00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:39.240
Just an excellence award isn't enough.

00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:39.760
From now on, you

00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:41.820
must only bring back championships.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.480
This little butterfly

00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:46.810
will serve as your motivation.

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:50.760
When you win all the league championships,

00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:52.520
only then can you take it off.

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:54.840
All league championships?

00:13:57.640 --> 00:13:59.160
I believe you can do it,

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:00.120
right?

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:07.600
My brother has always been
gentle and understanding,

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:08.530
yet determined.

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:11.680
Right?

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:19.200
Do you still miss him?

00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:25.200
He's gone.

00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:32.410
The moment I received
the death certificate,

00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:35.080
my marriage with Lu Sinan

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:37.920
legally

00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:39.120
came to an end.

00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:42.120
I have no connection

00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:45.770
with the Lu family anymore.

00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:47.480
I know.

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:50.600
Between you and our family,

00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:51.480
all that remains now is

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:53.740
the matter of dividing the inheritance.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:54.880
Cloud Manor

00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:57.220
and the Mare Nubium Hotel—

00:14:57.720 --> 00:14:58.980
they all belong to you.

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:02.130
What did you say?

00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:04.640
Even though I've been studying abroad,

00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:05.560
I know

00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:07.900
that the Mare Nubium Hotel

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:10.180
has always been your parents' property.

00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:12.560
My brother only obtained

00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:13.120
the shares

00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:15.380
as marital property after marrying you.

00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:16.680
Even Cloud Manor

00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:17.840
was purchased

00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:19.040
after your marriage.

00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:20.900
My brother is gone now.

00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:24.840
They shouldn't use this as an excuse

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:27.370
to forcibly take everything from you.

00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:32.280
I'm sorry.

00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:36.080
Why are you apologizing?

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:37.920
I apologize for my family,

00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:39.650
for not being able to stop them,

00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:43.480

I don't have much influence

over anything.

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:01.840

00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:38.640
It's impossible to retrieve them now

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:39.680
for a re-audit.

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:40.800
Who decided

00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:43.040
that archived reports
can't be re-examined?

00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:43.840
The former Vice President.

00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:45.920
Mare Nubium's annual audit

00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:47.400
concerns the entire group's income

00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:48.400
and expenditures.

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:50.120
With the new president just returning,

00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:51.160
a review

00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:52.400
is absolutely necessary.

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:53.720
Not just the Engineering Department,

00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:55.120
but the entire group's projects

00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:56.450
from the past five years

00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:59.480
must be re-examined if necessary.

00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:02.740
Audit Manager,

00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:05.040
re-examine all
of the Engineering Department's accounts

00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:06.880
from the past ten years.

00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:08.040
All of them?

00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:09.080
Yes.

00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:13.440
Any other questions?

00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:16.800
No.

00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:19.090
Meeting adjourned.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:29.760
Are you dissatisfied
with the new president

00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:30.640
or with me?

00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:32.530
I wouldn't dare.

00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:35.010
You're the new Vice President of Finance.

00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:37.420
I can only follow your instructions.

00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:39.810
How could I possibly be dissatisfied?

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:42.260
But your eyes and your expression

00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:44.280
seem to tell a different story.

00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:45.040
I understand

00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:47.680
that Haimeng needs to take control

00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:49.440
of the entire Mare Nubium
when she returns.

00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:50.400
But now,

00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:52.760
carrying out such an extensive audit
across all departments,

00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:53.520
I really don't believe

00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:55.780
it serves the company's best interests.

00:20:57.640 --> 00:20:59.520
Then may I ask, Manager Ye,

00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:01.840
what should Haimeng and I

00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:04.680
do at this moment?

00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:07.520
If Haimeng wants to reclaim
Mare Nubium's shares,

00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:09.600
she should address the Lu family properly.

00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:10.800
After Sinan's death,

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:12.400
the division of inheritance
should either follow

00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:13.560
legal procedures,

00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:14.920
or the elders
of both the Ye and Lu families

00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:15.760
should come together,

00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:16.880
place the interests

00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:17.560
of both families first,

00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:19.290
and resolve the matter fairly,

00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:20.720
without harming anyone.

00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:21.960
As for Mare Nubium,

00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:23.400
our focus should be

00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:25.640
on maintaining unity and stability,

00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:26.760
not letting shareholders

00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:28.200
feud and settle personal scores,

00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:30.480
which would only create internal turmoil.

00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:31.960
Have you ever heard the term

00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:33.120
"idealist"?

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:35.400
An idealist

00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:36.680
hopes that the world

00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:38.920
is pure and just.

00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:40.400
They believe

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:41.600
that people in the world

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:43.720
are kind at heart.

00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:45.890
But what about reality?

00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:47.760
If you don't know how to protect yourself—

00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:49.560
or if all you know
is protecting only yourself—

00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:50.400
then you

00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:52.240
and everything you own

00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:55.200
will eventually be carved up

00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:57.280
and torn apart.

00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:00.400
There's nothing wrong with being kind.

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:02.800
But being kind alone—that's the mistake.

00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:08.000
This has nothing to do with kindness.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:09.280
The Ye family and the Lu family

00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:10.160
could never achieve

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:11.320
what they want

00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:12.520
through ordinary legal means.

00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:13.960
Cloud Manor and Mare Nubium

00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:14.920
will never return

00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:16.560
to Haimeng without a fight.

00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:18.280
Even the Ye family

00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:20.080
you've humbled yourself to protect

00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:21.040
can't possibly

00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:22.500
remain peaceful forever.

00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:24.580
Those secrets buried underwater

00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:26.000
will eventually

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:27.400
come to light one day.

00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:34.720
The Ye family's secrets?

00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:36.040
Know where you stand.

00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:37.580
Take care of yourself.

00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:01.320
Have you seen enough?

00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:03.040
What if I say no?

00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:08.240
Then next time,

00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:10.580
please come in five minutes earlier.

00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:12.640
Why do I feel

00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:14.740
that your attitude toward him

00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:16.640
is quite peculiar?

00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:19.520
I'm just doing my job.

00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:22.000
Nothing like some people

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:23.860
who spend all their time together

00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:26.580
in far more delicate circumstances.

00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:31.730
What do you want from me?

00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:36.280
President Ye,

00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:37.040
Ms. Ling,

00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:38.120
I just received a call.

00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:39.080
Director Xia from our company

00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:40.600
has rallied several group shareholders

00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:41.840
and secured nearly half

00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:42.760
of the board's authorization.

00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:44.240
They're carrying
the authorization resolution

00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:45.280
and are already on their way

00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:46.810
to the President's Office.

00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:47.800
Director Xia?

00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:49.500
Authorization resolution?

00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:50.240
[Mare Nubium]

00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:51.160
I got a call from Director Chen yesterday

00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:51.840
asking about it.

00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:53.640
The board meeting
still has to be convened.

00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:54.240
Otherwise,

00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:56.040
all of these company decisions—

00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:03.520
[Mare Nubium]

00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:04.560
President Ye is here.

00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:05.360
Please get up.

00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:08.720
So what if she's here?

00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:09.640
I came today

00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:12.250
specifically to speak with President Ye.

00:24:14.290 --> 00:24:15.510
I was only gone for a few minutes,

00:24:15.510 --> 00:24:16.880
[Mare Nubium]

00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:18.940
yet everyone's already in an uproar.

00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:22.840
Director Xia,

00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:24.220
what's the matter?

00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:25.760
I've been following your father

00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:26.520
and your uncle

00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:27.920
in working with Mare Nubium

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:28.800
all these years.

00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:29.800
I watched helplessly

00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:31.360
as your Ye family went through upheaval.

00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:33.920
Fortunately, the Lu family
you married into

00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:35.440
had the backing of a major capital group,

00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:36.400
Changlu Group.

00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:37.040
Their support

00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:38.520
kept Mare Nubium

00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:40.120
from collapsing.

00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:44.160
Back then, we all thought

00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:45.680
you had left with Lu Sinan,

00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:47.650
yet here you are, alive.

00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:48.770
As a human being,

00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:50.770
you shouldn't be so heartless.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:52.920
Just say what you want to say.

00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:55.120
Since you don't want to listen,

00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:57.120
I won't beat around the bush either.

00:24:57.160 --> 00:24:58.360
This is Mare Nubium's resolution,

00:24:58.360 --> 00:25:00.720
signed by nearly half

00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:02.920
of the board's shareholders.

00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:04.800
We demand that the Ye and Lu families—

00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:06.760
specifically Lu Sinan and Ye Haimeng—

00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:08.400
publicly divide their jointly held shares

00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:09.800
and assets.

00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:10.650
We further demand

00:25:10.650 --> 00:25:10.920
[Mare Nubium]

00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:12.240
that a general shareholders' meeting
be convened

00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:13.760
to determine who holds

00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:14.400
Mare Nubium's

00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:15.800
largest stake

00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:17.160
and who is

00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:18.960
its highest-ranking director.

00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:20.200
The board has already notified

00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:21.520
the media

00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:23.280
that in seven days,

00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:25.400
on the fourth anniversary
of Mr. Lu Sinan's death,

00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:28.160
a meeting will be held
for all shareholders and the press.

00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:30.200
We also request that President Ye

00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:32.440
and Ms. Ling

00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:33.840
attend on time.

00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:35.200
Director Xia,

00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:37.600
you issued a public announcement

00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:39.860
without senior management's approval.

00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:42.650
That's effectively a coup.

00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:44.520
Ms. Ling,

00:25:45.050 --> 00:25:45.280
we're just trying to preserve transparency

00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:46.640
[Authorization Resolution
of Board of Directors]

00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:47.430
and fairness here.

00:25:47.430 --> 00:25:47.800
[Mare Nubium]

00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:49.860
You'll destroy Mare Nubium this way.

00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:51.440
[Authorization Resolution
of Board of Directors]

00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:53.700
No problem.

00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:54.640
Haimeng.

00:25:57.760 --> 00:25:58.920
Seven days later,

00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:01.460
see you at the public meeting.

00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:16.080
Why did you agree to that?

00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:20.280
They're just carrying out
the Lu family's orders,

00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:21.440
doing their dirty work.

00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:22.720
You mean Du Meiyun?

00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:26.280
Before we returned to the Lu family,

00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:27.160
we had a plan:

00:26:27.290 --> 00:26:27.890
[Mare Nubium]

00:26:27.890 --> 00:26:29.240
Return to Cloud Manor

00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:31.800
and gain the upper hand.

00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:33.200
Following the leads,

00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:35.120
we found my mother's whereabouts.

00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:37.120
With my mother's inherited shares,

00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:38.760
we regained

00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:40.400
control of Mare Nubium.

00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:42.000
Last time,

00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:43.710
we also recovered
Mare Nubium's official seal

00:26:43.710 --> 00:26:44.280
[Mare Nubium]

00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:45.040
and intercepted

00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:46.760
their application
to change the legal representative.

00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:49.920
And before the Lu family could react,

00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:51.480
we secured

00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:53.210
Lu Sinan's death certificate.

00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:54.520
So the actual control

00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:55.980
rests firmly in our hands.

00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:58.000
The only thing I'm missing is

00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:00.440
outright control

00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:03.520
of Mare Nubium's board.

00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:06.480
Without a clear majority stake

00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:07.920
in Mare Nubium,

00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:10.420
if the minor shareholders unite,

00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:13.000
my authority as President won't be secure.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:14.560
And to win the majority,

00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:15.960
we need to divide

00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:17.520
the joint shares Sinan and I held.

00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:19.960
That's the only leverage
the minority directors have over me

00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:21.920
and the Lu family's last trump card.

00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:22.960
You mean

00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:25.400
the property custody agreement

00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:27.680
Lu Sinan left behind?

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:29.520
Yes.

00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:31.320
We've never managed to obtain

00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:32.250
that agreement.

00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:35.080
As long as it remains
in the Lu family's hands,

00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:36.960
they'll continue to hold on to

00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:38.640
37% of Mare Nubium's shares.

00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:41.520
That means I can't become
the company's majority shareholder,

00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:43.280
and certainly can't secure

00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:45.010
absolute control of the board.

00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:46.240
This is indeed

00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:48.240
the Lu family's biggest trump card.

00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:49.850
So what do you plan to do?

00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:56.540
Return to Cloud Manor.

00:27:56.960 --> 00:27:58.600
Tell Jie to get ready.

00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:01.360
You're going back there yourself?

00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:03.000
The item is in Lu Siyu's room.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:04.600
And it's the room
where Lu Sinan used to live.

00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:05.280
No one but me

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:07.330
could possibly open it.

00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:10.920
No, it's too dangerous.

00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:12.320
[Mare Nubium]

00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:14.180
You were almost caught last time.

00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:19.500
No matter how dangerous it is,

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:21.460
can it be worse than death?

00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:22.800
Three years ago,

00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:24.880
I already died once.

00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:28.240
This time,

00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:32.560
I will survive.

00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:52.120
It's very quiet here.

00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:53.240
Nothing unusual.

00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:54.810
Where is Lu Siyu?

00:28:56.480 --> 00:28:58.480
He's been in his room the whole time.

00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:05.200
I'll get him to come out.

00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:07.000
Tell Jie to get ready.

00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:09.160
Time will be tighter this time.

00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:10.520
You need to be extra careful.

00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:11.160
I know.

00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:15.440
Lu Siyu!

00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:25.210
Lu Siyu, come out right now!

00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:33.360
Lu Siyu, come out now!

00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:37.120
What is it? It's so late.

00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:38.320
Why are you already in bed?

00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:39.040
I have to get up

00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:40.320
for training every morning.

00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:42.440
Not like you, Princess,

00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:44.170
get to enjoy your beauty sleep.

00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:45.840
How dare you!

00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:47.960
Talking to your sister like that.

00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:48.420
Come on.

00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:50.360
What?

00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:52.520
Did you withdraw

00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:54.040
a large sum of money today?

00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:54.720
The family's financial advisor

00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:55.920
called about it.

00:29:56.160 --> 00:29:57.160
Mom wants to know

00:29:57.160 --> 00:29:58.120
where you put

00:29:58.120 --> 00:29:59.000
all that money.

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:00.040
That's my own money.

00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:00.960
Do I really need to report

00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:02.120
to the family every time I spend?

00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:02.650
Let's go.

00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:04.160
Mom wants to ask you herself.

00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:04.760
Sis.

00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:05.600
Let's go.

00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:14.640
Wait a moment.

00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:16.880
What's wrong?

00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:19.040
Something's off today.

00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:20.300
You'd better not go in.

00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:22.780
Haven't fixed the surveillance?

00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:24.080
It's not about the surveillance.

00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:26.080
It's about Lu Siyue who just appeared.

00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:27.400
Don't you find it strange?

00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:28.760
They were checking accounts
in the middle of the night

00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:29.890
and took Lu Siyu away

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:31.460
without closing the door.

00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:35.400
It must have been Lu Siyu

00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:36.440
who invested a large sum of money,

00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:38.040
and now his family is asking about it.

00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:39.000
The open door

00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:40.680
doesn't seem odd

00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:43.280
Lu Siyu

00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:45.520
wouldn't have set a trap.

00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:47.290
Why do you trust him so much?

00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:48.770
[Don't forget—]

00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:50.320
[he's a Lu.]

00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:51.720
We're out of time.

00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:53.760
We must get the agreement today.

00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:55.000
Tell Jie

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:56.400
to take care of the surveillance cameras.

00:30:56.400 --> 00:30:57.080
Ye Haimeng!

00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:25.920
Are you half asleep?

00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:26.960
What's this about checking accounts

00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:28.420
in the middle of the night?

00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:29.730
Mom isn't even here.

00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:09.280
Siyu, open the door.

00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:10.520
I need to talk to you.

00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:13.560
What is it now?

00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:14.400
Can't whatever it is

00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:15.600
wait until tomorrow?

00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:16.720
It's so late.

00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:17.680
No.

00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:19.200
I have to tell you now.

00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:19.840
Open up!

00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:22.520
I'm already in bed.

00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:24.480
Open the door, Siyu.

00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:37.450
Who's there?

00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:40.320
Who is it?

00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:45.290
What's happening in your room?

00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:48.440
Open the door, Siyu!

00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:50.640
Open up!

00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:54.760
Lu Siyu, open the door!

00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:57.040
Siyu, open the door now.

00:32:57.480 --> 00:32:58.760
Open up, Siyu!

00:32:58.760 --> 00:32:59.720
Open the door!
