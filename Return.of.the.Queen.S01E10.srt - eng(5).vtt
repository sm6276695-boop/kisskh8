Let go of me.

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:59.490
I need to talk to you.

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:00.520
Let go of me.

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.240
Let me finish what I have to say,

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:03.640
or I won't let go.

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.760
Go ahead.

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.240
Why did you insist

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:14.170
that I bring the authentication report
to the scene?

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:15.850
Did you do it on purpose?

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.720
Yes.

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:25.480
Why?

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.720
You have so many people working for you.

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.800
You could have easily asked

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.320
them to get the book from me,

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:33.000
and then had Bochen

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.460
take the handwriting analysis
to the scene.

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:37.760
Why did it have to be me?

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:40.610
What do you think

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:42.760
is the reason?

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:47.720
Because your last name is Lu.

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.240
Only when you show up
with the authentication report

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:53.640
can I gain the trust

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:56.280
of the media and reporters at the scene.

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:58.440
Only when you personally

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:59.680
bring back the report

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:02.080
can I break down

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:03.760
your Lu family's

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.400
last line of defense.

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:09.400
Lu Siyu.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:13.880
You are the knife

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:15.680
I stabbed into

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.180
the hearts of your family.

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:20.820
Do you understand?

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:22.320
I don't.

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.760
I don't believe you're
this kind of person.

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:27.880
I don't believe you got close to me

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:28.960
just to use me

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:30.560
to hurt my family.

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.200
I told you long ago.

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:34.880
Don't get close to me.

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:36.120
Don't trust me.

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.440
Don't take my side.

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:39.450
I am the mortal enemy

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:41.640
of your family.

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:43.880
I fought desperately

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:45.980
to survive that car accident,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.680
just to take back

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.280
everything that belongs to me

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:50.840
from your family.

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:52.680
From now on,

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:53.610
I'll cut all ties

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:55.280
with your Lu family.

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:02.480
What about me?

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:05.600
You?

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:09.040
Do I mean nothing

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:12.480
to you at all?

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:17.850
During the past few months,

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:19.660

am I absolutely

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:26.120
nothing to you?

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:27.200
You are

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:31.880
nothing to me.

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:18.200
You and I

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:21.680

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:25.090
any relationship in this life.

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:30.560
Being surnamed Lu

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:33.720

I'm asking you a question.

Don't you know that sometimes

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:53.560

Today,

we should celebrate for her.

and those board members?

00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:14.160
Many of the board members

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:15.120
built the company

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:16.760

Now the former chairman is gone.

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:19.200
Haimeng has taken over.

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:19.960
But those people have lost

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:21.120
the careers they've built

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:21.600
for over 10 years,

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:22.960
due to the feud with the Lu family.

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:23.800
First of all,

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:25.840
choosing sides in the workplace

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:26.440
is something that

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:28.040
requires great wisdom.

00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:29.200
Secondly,

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:30.840
not all founding members

and kindness at their core.

00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:37.680
Finally,

people change,

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:43.690
especially after experiencing risks

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:45.440
and long periods

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:46.560
of waiting.

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:48.400
Haimeng

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:49.880
has never been a weak person

00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:51.400
who needs to rely on others.

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:52.930
She doesn't need sympathy.

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:54.460
She doesn't need pity.

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:56.480
She doesn't need anyone to save her.

00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:58.560
She herself

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:00.720
is her own savior.

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:02.120
You really know her well.

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:04.160
You've been away for too long

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:05.120
and misunderstood her.

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:05.680
Then...

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:08.460
What about you?

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:13.080

Where did you come from?

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:19.690
Where did you meet Haimeng?

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:21.280
How did you end up

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:22.000

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.040
with her from abroad

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:24.370
after the car accident?

00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:26.090
What's your real identity?

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:28.100
How long will you stay by her side?

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:28.920
Or

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:30.760
what exactly do you want?

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:32.760
You're so curious about me?

00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:33.400
Yes, I am.

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:36.160
If you want to know my true identity,

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:37.800
why not trade one of your secrets

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:38.680

What secrets do I have?

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:46.200
For example,

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:48.140
your surname isn't really Ye.

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:50.160
Is it a secret?

00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:01.400
How does it feel

00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:03.800
to be the subdued adopted son
of the Ye family

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:04.800
for 20 years?

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:12.450
How did you know?

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:16.240
I've told you before.

00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:18.280
I know all the secrets of your family,

00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:19.210
whether they're

00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:20.720
on the table, under the water,
hidden at home,

00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:21.560
or buried underground.

00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:22.440
I know them all.

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:25.600
Before I find evidence

00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:27.760
for each one

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:29.170
of these secrets

00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:30.880
and dig out the truth,

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:34.320
you'd better put away your kindness

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:35.740
and protect yourself.

00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:01.820
[Mare Nubium]

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:08.600
[Mare Nubium]

00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:10.200
Please be seated, everyone.

00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:14.960
From today onwards,

00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:15.880
Mare Nubium

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:17.780
has returned to the Ye family.

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:20.040
The control of the board

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:22.160
has also been transferred to me.

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:22.880
Everything from the past

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:23.810
is now behind us.

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:25.240
Today

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:26.360
is Mare Nubium's

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:27.680
first new workday.

00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:30.360
We're starting fresh.

00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:32.440
From now on,

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:33.320
you will all be the ones

00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:34.470
moving forward with me.

00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:35.760
[Mare Nubium]

00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:36.760
Please be seated.

00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:45.720
[Mare Nubium]

00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:56.770
Begin your reports.

00:14:57.720 --> 00:14:59.680
From November 1st last year to now,

00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:00.360
our property rental rate

00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:01.560
has reached 79%.

00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:02.800
Regarding operations,

00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:03.320
we have already developed

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:04.440
the new year's marketing plan.

00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:05.120
All major objectives

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:06.400
are progressing steadily.

00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:07.560
The Legal Department

00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:08.560
has accumulated quite a lot of work

00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:10.090
over the past two quarters.

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:10.640
Besides

00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:12.160
the termination contracts

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:13.440
from the HR Department,

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:15.800
there's also
the overseas investment agreement

00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:16.600
that Mr. Jiang

00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:22.000
and Ms. Lu

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:22.640
pushed through

00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:23.840
3 or 4 months ago.

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:25.460
Overseas investment?

00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:26.480
Yes.

00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:28.160
It's about our group's

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:30.290
joint venture brand stores overseas.

00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:32.120
Before you returned,

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:33.120
Jiang Lin

00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:34.560
and Ms. Lu

00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:35.680
specifically went abroad

00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:37.080
to visit 4-5 countries.

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:38.360
They planned

00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:39.280
to purchase large parcels

00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:40.800
of land there

00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:42.040
to establish our new

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:43.820
overseas brand division.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.400
They want to buy land

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:47.360
instead of acquiring hotels?

00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:47.880
Yes.

00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:49.560
But actually

00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:51.680
when the former chairman was around,

00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:52.360
our group

00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:53.440
rarely purchased

00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:54.240
land overseas.

00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:55.000
We always bought

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.080
local brands

00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:57.200
to develop them into

00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:58.530
our own joint ventures.

00:15:59.120 --> 00:15:59.920
That's right.

00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:02.920
When my father expanded the market,

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
he never got involved in land deals.

00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:06.560
Furthermore,

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:09.480
the transaction amount is indeed enormous.

00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:10.600
So our department

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.530
didn't report it promptly.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.200
But unexpectedly,

00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:15.800
this delayed reporting

00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:16.400
has caused

00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:18.460
this investment agreement to stall.

00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:20.200
It's still stuck like this until now.

00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:22.060
And you've returned from abroad.

00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:24.280
Being cautious was the right move.

00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:26.240
Sort out this investment agreement.

00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:27.480
Take it to the Secretary's Office

00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:28.600
and hand it to Tan Xin.

00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:29.200
Okay.

00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:31.720
Tan Xin.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.080
After you get the contract,

00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:34.680
immediately investigate both parties
of the transaction,

00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:36.880
their accounts, transaction records,

00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:38.320
as well as the background and details

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:39.520
of the land involved.

00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:41.400
After the investigation,

00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:42.800
report everything to me.

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:44.490
Understood, President Ye.

00:16:45.290 --> 00:16:50.920
[Mare Nubium]

00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:52.320
Thank you, President Ye.

00:16:57.520 --> 00:16:58.850
Anything for me to sign?

00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:00.640
No.

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:03.250
So you're just going to stand there

00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:04.200
staring at me?

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:06.410
I stay behind specifically

00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:07.740
to admire your beauty.

00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:12.359
Alright.

00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:14.280
I have two things to tell you.

00:17:14.319 --> 00:17:14.839
First,

00:17:15.319 --> 00:17:17.319
I would like to audit the accounts
of the Construction Department,

00:17:17.319 --> 00:17:18.640
including but not limited to

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:20.280
all the projects handled
by your uncle Ye Yuezhi

00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:21.560
during his tenure.

00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:23.839
Approved.

00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:25.800
But I should warn you.

00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:27.119
Be careful about

00:17:27.119 --> 00:17:28.480
Ye Bochen's reaction.

00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:29.360
What?

00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:31.400
You're worried I can't handle him?

00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:32.560
I'm worried

00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:35.640
he'll handle you.

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:41.480
The second thing?

00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:44.300
I want to invite you

00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:45.900
back to the penthouse.

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:48.120
Cloud Manor and Mare Nubium

00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:50.000
have been successfully reclaimed by us.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.400
The plans we made

00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:52.400
in the penthouse

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:54.000
have all been accomplished.

00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:55.000
So I think

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:56.400
all those files and photos

00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:57.760
on the penthouse walls

00:17:57.760 --> 00:17:59.160
should be taken down by you personally.

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:00.120
You should know

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:01.400
my goal

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:02.660
isn't just Cloud Manor

00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:05.240
and Mare Nubium.

00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:06.280
Of course I know.

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:08.200
Otherwise, after helping you secure

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:09.920
Cloud Manor and Mare Nubium,

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:11.120
I would have left already.

00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:12.320
I still remember

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.560
the deal we made

00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:16.960
at the missionary hospital abroad.

00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:20.080
You haven't told me yet

00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:21.360
who your target is.

00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:22.960
Come back to the penthouse with me.

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:24.080
And I'll tell you everything.

00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:24.680
Alright.

00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:26.560
Tomorrow at 8 p.m.,

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:28.080
I'll be there.

00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:29.360
Good.

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:31.240
I'll head out now.

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:34.400
Oh, by the way.

00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:37.680
That young friend of yours...

00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:38.740
What young friend?

00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:41.980
Better not to have any.

00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:42.840
I've realized

00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:44.200
I like you more and more.

00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:45.360
President Ye.

00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:59.380
[Mare Nubium]

00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:38.520
He's amazing!

00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:39.800
Every single shot

00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:41.280
hits the bullseye.

00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:41.920
I just asked

00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:43.320
the receptionist about him.

00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:45.000
He's the owner of this archery club,

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:46.640
who just returned from abroad.

00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:48.160
The earring is beautiful.

00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:49.760
I just wonder

00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:50.400
if the ruby

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:51.560
is real or fake.

00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:53.080
It's gorgeous.

00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:07.760
Excuse me.

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:09.400
The earring is mine.

00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:10.840
I've been keeping it here.

00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:11.440
It must have

00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:13.240
fallen on the floor by accident.

00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:16.080
What are you doing?

00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:17.360
The earring belongs to me.

00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:18.400
I found it in the hallway

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:19.560
to the changing rooms.

00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:20.600
I asked all the girls around

00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:22.200
and couldn't find the owner.

00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:24.040
How could it possibly be yours?

00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:24.640
And the earring

00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:25.840
is for women.

00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:27.880
The earring is indeed mine.

00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:29.520
I brought it back from abroad.

00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:30.080
I always keep it

00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:31.400
pinned to my archery armor.

00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:32.680
It probably fell off

00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:34.540
in the changing room by accident.

00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:35.480
Excuse me.

00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:37.360
Keep your hands to yourself.

00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:39.210
My girlfriend already said

00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:41.520
no girl reported any missing earring.

00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:42.960
Besides, you're a man.

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:44.440
How could you claim it's yours?

00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:45.520
And who would ever pin something

00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:46.760
like this to his armor?

00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:47.520
Exactly.

00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:50.280
This is indeed mine.

00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:50.920
Fine.

00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:53.370
If you insist it's yours, that's fine.

00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:56.120
Your bow looks quite professional.

00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:56.980
How about this?

00:20:57.400 --> 00:20:58.460
Let's have a match.

00:20:58.960 --> 00:20:59.600
If you win,

00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:01.280
we'll just bite the bullet
and give you the earring.

00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:02.160
If you lose...

00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:03.440
They're going to compete

00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:04.600
for that earring.

00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:06.400
That guy definitely can't do it.

00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:07.280
This guy is a professional player.

00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:08.740
There's no way to beat him.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:09.930
I agree with you.

00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:11.800
He definitely can't beat the boss.

00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:12.360
Fine.

00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:14.760
Three arrows to decide the winner.

00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:16.040
Whoever scores the higher total wins.

00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:18.360
The winner takes the ruby earring.

00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:20.760
The loser must accept the outcome.

00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:23.080
You can start now.

00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:29.960
Wow, bullseye!

00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:30.400
Bullseye!

00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:30.840
I told you.

00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:32.170
This guy is really good.

00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:34.600
That person definitely can't beat him.

00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:41.600
Another bullseye!

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:42.640
No wonder he's a professional player

00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:43.760
who has won championships.

00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:44.600
He's amazing.

00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:48.520
Wait a minute.

00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:50.920
You're a professional, right?

00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:52.400
A professional who's won championships

00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:53.920
competes against an amateur like me.

00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:55.250
Isn't that a bit unfair?

00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:58.000
What do you want then?

00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.330
You're a professional.

00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:01.300
We can't play by normal rules.

00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:03.820
For the last arrow,

00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:06.760
do you dare to blindfold yourself?

00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:07.840
As long as you hit the target,

00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:08.880
no matter what score you get,

00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:09.440
I'll return the earring.

00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:10.400
It's not fair.

00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:12.020
Do you dare?

00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:14.000

00:23:57.160 --> 00:23:57.880
How could we

00:23:57.880 --> 00:23:59.240
move to a place like this?

00:23:59.240 --> 00:23:59.880
My room is as tiny

00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:01.320
as a bird's nest.

00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:03.520

00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:05.210

00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:08.920
Be grateful you have a place to live.

00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:11.380
All our assets are
in your father's control.

00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:12.850
He asked us to live here.

00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:14.360
You think I want this?

00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:15.720
Doesn't our Changlu Group focus

00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:17.760
specifically on real estate investment?

00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:18.280
How could we suddenly

00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:19.920
lose even our own villa?

00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:22.800
Could it be that Dad's business

00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:23.600
is in trouble?

00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:26.640
Don't talk like that

00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:28.700
in front of your father, understand?

00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:32.440
Your father doesn't let us get involved
with the company.

00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:33.760
I don't know

00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:35.560
the specific situation either.

00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:38.120
You've been married to Dad
for so many years,

00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:38.680
yet you're not even allowed

00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:40.680
to lay a finger on the family assets.

00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:41.600
I really wonder

00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:43.400
if he sees you as his life partner

00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:45.660
or just because Sinan's mother died,

00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:47.300
he's using you as a backup.

00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:50.960
How dare you talk to me like that?

00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:52.160
No manners at all.

00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:57.440
Mom.

00:24:57.800 --> 00:24:59.240
Please help Jiang Lin.

00:24:59.240 --> 00:24:59.600
He really

00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:01.760
has nothing to do
with Ye Haimeng's mother's death.

00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:02.760
You can't just watch him

00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:03.560
being detained

00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:05.360
and suffering in there, right?

00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:06.960
Mom.

00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:08.780
Why don't we go find Chen Mo

00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:10.980
to get your son-in-law out first?

00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:13.040
Didn't I just say

00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:14.400
that Changlu's resources

00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:15.640
aren't in our hands?

00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:17.640
Chen Mo only listens to your father.

00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:18.700
How can we help him?

00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:19.690
Alright.

00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:20.880
Don't worry.

00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:22.880
As long as Jiang Lin truly

00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:24.200
has nothing to do with this,

00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:25.640
he'll be released soon.

00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:28.000
But he's been taken away
for 10 days already.

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:28.920
Stop shouting.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:30.680
Just wait.

00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:32.040
I can do nothing.

00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:34.920
Mom, how can you be like this?

00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:38.780
Mom, do you really not care
about us anymore?

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:39.320
Mom!

00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:39.960
Mom!

00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:45.600
When they were bossing Jiang Lin around,

00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:47.200
they complained he wasn't capable enough.

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:49.200
Now he's sacrificing for this family,

00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:51.460
but no one cares whether he lives or dies.

00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:53.840
Fine.

00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:56.200
If none of you care about him,

00:25:56.840 --> 00:25:58.040
I'll save him myself.

00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:01.520
Do you really plan to stay here

00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:02.980
and never come home again?

00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:06.320
Mom was just speaking
out of anger that day.

00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:07.080
You're not that old,

00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:08.480
but your temper sure has gotten worse.

00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:09.320
Our family is now

00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:10.280
going through difficult times.

00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:12.160
You can't just abandon our family.

00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:13.120
It has nothing to do with me.

00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:14.250
What are you saying?

00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:16.260
Aren't you a part of the Lu family?

00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:18.520
Such a big thing has happened
to our family.

00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:19.360
How can you possibly think

00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:20.960
it has nothing to do with you?

00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:22.520
If I had a choice,

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.060
I'd rather not be a part of the family.

00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:29.640
Lu Siyu, stop right there!

00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:31.520
Lu Siyu!

00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:33.250
What do you mean by that?

00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:35.000
Are you trying to disown your family?

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:35.840
Has that woman brainwashed

00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:36.720
you so thoroughly

00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:39.000
that you even turn your back
on your family?

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:40.280
I've told you before.

00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:42.010
She never had good intentions.

00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:44.120
She hurt Sinan before,

00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:45.980
and now she's back to hurt you too.

00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:48.800
My dear brother, wake up!

00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:49.880
Lu Siyu.

00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:51.400
If you hate her

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:53.120
and you're angry,

00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:54.720
then come with me and confront her.

00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:55.280
I have a plan

00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:56.760
to turn the tables

00:26:57.520 --> 00:26:58.520
for the Lu family.

00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:00.770
What do you mean?

00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:02.480
Don't you think

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:04.730
Sinan's death was suspicious?

00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:06.880
They were both

00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:08.760
in that car accident abroad.

00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:11.280
Sinan died instantly.

00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:12.560
Why could she return

00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:13.240
three years later,

00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:14.640
safe and sound?

00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:16.400
And

00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:19.440
during these three years she was missing,

00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:21.000
where exactly was she?

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:22.520
Is she hiding something?

00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:24.480
Or did she deliberately cover up the truth

00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:25.680
behind it all?

00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:30.160
So

00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:32.920
you suspect...

00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:33.440
Yes.

00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:36.360
I suspect Sinan's accident

00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:39.530
wasn't that simple.

00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:41.040
I can't understand

00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:42.160
these French reports.

00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:43.040
