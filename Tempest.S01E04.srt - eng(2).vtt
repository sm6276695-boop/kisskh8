00:00:11.386 --> 00:00:12.554
Wow…

00:00:13.972 --> 00:00:17.309
Apparently, throughout his career
as a bodyguard,

00:00:17.392 --> 00:00:20.979
not a single person who's been under
the protection of Mr. Paik has ever died.

00:00:21.063 --> 00:00:22.564
I think he's just the person we need.

00:00:22.648 --> 00:00:25.609
Nobody knows how many civilians
he's killed over there.

00:00:26.193 --> 00:00:30.822
Mr. Paik Sanho is nothing more
than an international contract killer.

00:00:30.906 --> 00:00:33.992
But what's more important
than safety when it comes to security?

00:00:39.081 --> 00:00:40.123
{\an8}IRAQ, 2007

00:00:40.207 --> 00:00:43.252
{\an8}From what I found,
he obtained US citizenship in '06.

00:00:43.335 --> 00:00:45.546
{\an8}In '07, he was deployed to Iraq.

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.716
At the same time, Valkyrie was scouring
the world to recruit special ops veterans

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.804
from Nepal, Serbia, Chile, Ecuador,
and Honduras.

00:00:53.887 --> 00:00:57.015
Mr. Paik was previously registered
as Mongolian.

00:00:57.683 --> 00:00:59.434
He doesn't look Mongolian.

00:01:00.185 --> 00:01:03.730
Mongolia was just
a useful stop for a passport change.

00:01:03.814 --> 00:01:05.774
He looks Korean and speaks fluent Korean.

00:01:05.857 --> 00:01:08.318
So what do you think
his real nationality is?

00:02:05.876 --> 00:02:08.086
He volunteers
at the Peace and Forgiveness church,

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.422
known for its congregation
of North Korean defectors.

00:02:10.505 --> 00:02:13.216
So what if he's DPRK Special Forces?

00:02:14.635 --> 00:02:19.014
So you're saying that
he could be a spy from North Korea

00:02:19.097 --> 00:02:22.017
and he had an ulterior motive
in approaching me?

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.143
Yeah.

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:26.313
Find some evidence first.

00:02:34.655 --> 00:02:35.697
What concerns me

00:02:35.781 --> 00:02:38.492
is we don't know
why he approached you in the first place.

00:02:38.575 --> 00:02:39.868
Let me figure that out.

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:45.040
Dear Ms. Seo,
I hope this mail finds you well.

00:02:45.832 --> 00:02:50.754
If I were to pick one of us to protect
my own mother, it'd be Mark. No question.

00:02:50.837 --> 00:02:52.839
{\an8}PARIS, 2008

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:44.975
Back during
the Paris nightclub attack,

00:03:45.058 --> 00:03:48.687
Mark was the one who safely extracted
the Saudi oil billionaire's daughter,

00:03:49.354 --> 00:03:50.814
not a scratch on her.

00:03:53.316 --> 00:03:57.863
Whoever you are, whatever you do,
if you feel as though you are in danger,

00:03:58.405 --> 00:04:00.699
I insist you take Mark's services.

00:04:01.241 --> 00:04:03.869
That is, if he accepts the job offer.

00:04:32.773 --> 00:04:36.067
TEMPEST

00:04:36.151 --> 00:04:40.530
{\an8}Beijing welcomes the president today
as she begins her visit to China

00:04:40.614 --> 00:04:42.783
{\an8}in attendance
of the Beijing Climate Forum.

00:04:43.617 --> 00:04:46.578
{\an8}President Chae will be heading straight
to the China National Convention Center…

00:04:46.661 --> 00:04:48.663
{\an8}Why do you think
the president went to Beijing?

00:04:48.747 --> 00:04:51.416
Climate doesn't seem like
her real concern right now.

00:04:51.917 --> 00:04:55.921
She's probably asking for help
from China. To act as a mediator.

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:58.215
{\an8}Not much of a welcome.

00:04:58.298 --> 00:05:01.802
No Chinese government officials
showed up, just the ambassador.

00:05:02.594 --> 00:05:05.096
All the Chinese officials
are at the state guesthouse.

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:07.140
The US VP made a surprise visit…

00:05:07.224 --> 00:05:08.433
…to Beijing this morning.

00:05:10.018 --> 00:05:11.144
IN FRONT OF BUILDING 18

00:05:11.228 --> 00:05:13.438
AT THE ZHONGNANHAI STATE
GUESTHOUSE THIS MORNING

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:21.446
There's one more guest there.

00:05:22.823 --> 00:05:26.660
This photo was snapped outside
of Building 18 earlier at the guesthouse.

00:05:26.743 --> 00:05:28.829
Madam Cho and Jin Suryeon?

00:05:29.746 --> 00:05:32.499
Kim Hansang's
English and Chinese translators.

00:05:32.582 --> 00:05:36.086
Mr. Kim must be sitting at the table
with the US VP,

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:40.715
all while our president is abandoned
outside, waiting and sweating in the heat.

00:05:41.299 --> 00:05:43.426
But why would China prefer a war?

00:05:44.135 --> 00:05:46.513
The border region could end up
as a nuclear target.

00:05:46.596 --> 00:05:48.306
As we speak,

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:51.643
the power dynamics are
shifting dramatically.

00:05:51.726 --> 00:05:57.107
China, Russia, and even Idisha in
the Middle East are forming an alliance.

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:59.568
A new sphere of influence is developing.

00:05:59.651 --> 00:06:01.945
Now, assuming North Korea joins as well…

00:06:04.197 --> 00:06:08.410
…the US faces the biggest threat to
international order since World War II.

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:12.455
The two sides could end up
fighting on the Korean Peninsula,

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:15.166
the only nation
made of two divided countries.

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:21.089
Well, I did hear the CIA director
showed up in Seoul this afternoon.

00:06:22.257 --> 00:06:25.594
Someone at that level would've
come here to meet with the president.

00:06:25.677 --> 00:06:28.221
But she's out of the country.

00:06:29.014 --> 00:06:30.765
What could be the reason then?

00:06:31.683 --> 00:06:33.101
He could be here for you.

00:06:33.977 --> 00:06:34.978
You think so?

00:06:35.061 --> 00:06:39.065
I'm afraid if Junik's death was the work
of the United States,

00:06:39.149 --> 00:06:42.444
they could see you
as a very serious threat.

00:06:43.445 --> 00:06:47.240
They'll be wondering what you know,
and what would happen to the peninsula,

00:06:47.324 --> 00:06:50.160
if you were to become
the President of South Korea.

00:06:50.994 --> 00:06:53.538
The United States bombed the train.

00:06:54.039 --> 00:06:56.124
They will never stop hunting you.

00:06:56.916 --> 00:06:58.126
That's fine.

00:06:59.252 --> 00:07:02.714
Their desperation to kill me
just shows that I have power.

00:07:03.965 --> 00:07:07.927
From the US perspective, the
reason that they see you as such a threat

00:07:09.596 --> 00:07:12.390
is you capture the hearts and minds
of the public.

00:07:12.974 --> 00:07:15.602
You have to rally their support
as much as you can.

00:07:16.186 --> 00:07:20.190
To make them want peaceful reunification.

00:07:21.066 --> 00:07:25.028
And that…
that will be your greatest asset.

00:07:39.876 --> 00:07:40.877
Mother.

00:07:43.088 --> 00:07:44.506
What are you doing out here?

00:07:44.589 --> 00:07:45.882
Oh, Munju.

00:07:45.965 --> 00:07:49.260
Aren't you moving out tomorrow?
You packed already?

00:07:49.344 --> 00:07:52.514
I'm not taking much anyway.
Just bringing myself, I guess.

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:57.686
You're moving out for security reasons?

00:08:00.355 --> 00:08:01.356
Yes.

00:08:02.315 --> 00:08:05.151
Your new security guard,
Paik Sanho, was it?

00:08:05.235 --> 00:08:06.444
Is he making you do this?

00:08:11.741 --> 00:08:13.201
You know what, Mother?

00:08:13.785 --> 00:08:15.620
I never really liked this place.

00:08:15.704 --> 00:08:18.873
I heard you insisted on hiring him.

00:08:18.957 --> 00:08:21.167
What are people going to say about that?

00:08:21.251 --> 00:08:24.295
Fortunately, I've never cared about
what other people think.

00:08:25.463 --> 00:08:28.216
I don't doubt that. You had your reasons.

00:08:28.299 --> 00:08:31.469
After all, you're a smart girl.
But I'll give you some advice.

00:08:32.929 --> 00:08:37.600
That young man is clearly the type
who could stir a lady's heart.

00:08:37.684 --> 00:08:39.436
That mercenary has saved you twice.

00:08:39.519 --> 00:08:41.563
He nearly died this last time.

00:08:42.355 --> 00:08:44.357
Every human is foolish.

00:08:45.108 --> 00:08:48.069
But if they're lonely,
they become irrational.

00:08:51.031 --> 00:08:54.409
Give in to your emotions
and it will ruin everything.

00:08:54.492 --> 00:08:57.078
I don't think
that was a coincidence, Mother.

00:08:57.871 --> 00:09:00.832
I am positive he had his reasons
for doing what he did.

00:09:00.915 --> 00:09:02.834
I'd like to know why he saved me.

00:09:02.917 --> 00:09:06.629
You're risking it all, your reputation,
for that?

00:09:06.713 --> 00:09:09.466
If it means I can find out
why Junik was murdered?

00:09:11.009 --> 00:09:12.677
I'd risk everything I have.

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:16.014
Because right now,
every door in front of me is locked.

00:09:18.224 --> 00:09:20.769
And the only key I've got in my hands
is Sanho.

00:09:22.812 --> 00:09:24.397
I'm going to unlock the door

00:09:25.565 --> 00:09:27.400
and see where it leads.

00:09:34.115 --> 00:09:35.366
Hold on, Ms. Seo.

00:09:38.536 --> 00:09:40.121
I open every door first.

00:10:08.066 --> 00:10:09.359
This will be every time?

00:10:09.943 --> 00:10:10.985
Yes.

00:10:20.578 --> 00:10:22.122
Do you really need to put this here?

00:10:22.997 --> 00:10:23.998
Why?

00:10:24.082 --> 00:10:25.834
I don't like things
placed next to the bed.

00:10:25.917 --> 00:10:28.837
It's the perfect spot to hide a bug
or a camera.

00:10:38.096 --> 00:10:40.056
Oh, wow! This spot is just perfect.

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:42.892
We couldn't have asked for
a better floor plan or location.

00:10:42.976 --> 00:10:44.060
How'd I even find it?

00:10:48.356 --> 00:10:49.566
You can't open the windows.

00:10:49.649 --> 00:10:51.442
I can't open any windows here?

00:10:51.526 --> 00:10:53.278
A sniper will aim for a window.

00:10:53.361 --> 00:10:55.780
I've applied bulletproof film to them.

00:10:57.448 --> 00:10:58.616
Look, Mr. Paik.

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:00.660
We're not in America.

00:11:01.161 --> 00:11:02.787
Guns are illegal in this country.

00:11:03.371 --> 00:11:06.291
Even prisoners have a right
to some sunlight and fresh air.

00:11:06.374 --> 00:11:07.584
I can't even have that?

00:11:08.209 --> 00:11:10.837
I carry a gun, even though it's illegal.

00:11:11.462 --> 00:11:12.505
What?

00:11:13.214 --> 00:11:15.425
Gun restrictions don't matter
to an assassin.

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:20.763
Oh, Ms. Seo?
Is it okay if I setup my office in here?

00:11:20.847 --> 00:11:23.057
The previous resident was
an elderly person,

00:11:23.141 --> 00:11:25.226
so this used to be the caretaker's room.

00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:27.478
This way I can crash here
when we work late.

00:11:27.562 --> 00:11:28.771
I'll be sleeping in here.

00:11:28.855 --> 00:11:31.566
- What?
- I'll be sleeping in this room.

00:11:33.526 --> 00:11:36.112
You know, Mr. Paik,
why not use the room across the hall?

00:11:36.196 --> 00:11:38.031
That should be enough
for security purposes.

00:11:38.698 --> 00:11:41.326
Well, that does place one extra door
that's in my way.

00:11:42.076 --> 00:11:44.412
In an emergency,
I'd need to get through both doors.

00:11:44.954 --> 00:11:46.331
That's two extra seconds

00:11:46.915 --> 00:11:49.292
and enough time
for six bullets to be fired.

00:11:49.375 --> 00:11:52.503
This room is the only reason
I approved this location.

00:11:53.755 --> 00:11:54.964
I'm sleeping in here.

00:11:55.048 --> 00:11:58.718
I can't let you stay in a room with her,
especially if it locks from the inside.

00:12:00.053 --> 00:12:03.348
Okay. I'll let you figure this out.
Excuse me.

00:12:03.431 --> 00:12:06.184
Here's hoping you two can
reach a fair agreement.

00:12:06.267 --> 00:12:07.644
Ms. Seo, what do you think?

00:12:07.727 --> 00:12:10.063
I'll sleep in here.
That solve the problem?

00:12:10.146 --> 00:12:12.357
The two of you can share the big bed.

00:12:12.982 --> 00:12:15.443
Mr. Paik, I'd like to speak to you.

00:12:15.526 --> 00:12:16.861
Give us the room, please.

00:12:18.029 --> 00:12:19.030
Come on.

00:12:24.661 --> 00:12:27.330
I appreciate your perfectionism
when it comes to security,

00:12:27.413 --> 00:12:29.290
but your job is to protect me
so I can work.

00:12:29.374 --> 00:12:31.584
I have more to do than just stay safe.

00:12:31.668 --> 00:12:34.796
I always respect the opinions of my team.

00:12:35.713 --> 00:12:37.882
And if you can't learn
to coordinate with them,

00:12:39.133 --> 00:12:40.593
we can't work together.

00:12:40.677 --> 00:12:42.679
You think I was aiming for perfection?

00:12:44.013 --> 00:12:45.598
I wish that were possible.

00:12:45.682 --> 00:12:47.850
There's no such thing as perfection here.

00:12:47.934 --> 00:12:51.854
To achieve that, I'd have to lock you
in a room with no windows or doors.

00:12:52.563 --> 00:12:53.940
And it still wouldn't be enough.

00:12:54.023 --> 00:12:55.942
Someone could blow up the room.

00:13:20.425 --> 00:13:23.177
Ms. Lim,
she's waiting in the living room.

00:13:35.356 --> 00:13:37.608
- Hello, Mother.
- Am I interrupting?

00:13:37.692 --> 00:13:39.027
No, it's okay.

00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:40.778
Don't mind me,
please keep working.

00:13:47.285 --> 00:13:49.245
How'd you find such a perfect house?

00:13:49.328 --> 00:13:50.997
Miji searched all over the city.

00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:53.666
And luckily, this place opened up
just at the right time.

00:13:54.208 --> 00:13:55.626
What is he doing?

00:13:55.710 --> 00:13:57.545
He cooks for her too?

00:13:58.254 --> 00:14:01.257
The new head of security
doesn't trust any of us.

00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:04.260
He insisted that
he personally cook for Ms. Seo,

00:14:04.343 --> 00:14:06.345
using ingredients
from a monastery he knows.

00:14:06.846 --> 00:14:11.726
So he'll be cooking every meal for her,
he stays within arm's reach at all times,

00:14:11.809 --> 00:14:13.853
and even sleeps just a door away from her?

00:14:15.396 --> 00:14:18.941
I want you to keep a close eye
on those two. Something seems off.

00:14:20.109 --> 00:14:21.110
Yes, ma'am.

00:14:25.948 --> 00:14:27.909
Here's the bombing report from the NIS,

00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:30.036
for your perusal.

00:14:39.504 --> 00:14:40.880
I also have

00:14:42.381 --> 00:14:43.549
a small favor to ask.

00:14:46.594 --> 00:14:47.845
The NIS…

00:14:49.931 --> 00:14:51.557
has been wiretapping my house.

00:14:52.517 --> 00:14:54.519
Junik was suspected of spying.

00:14:55.228 --> 00:14:58.523
They think that Junik was
a spy? That's ridiculous.

00:14:58.606 --> 00:14:59.816
Well, of course it is.

00:14:59.899 --> 00:15:01.359
But there has to be a reason.

00:15:02.693 --> 00:15:04.112
Search my house.

00:15:04.904 --> 00:15:07.115
Cameras, microphones, look for anything.

00:15:07.198 --> 00:15:11.035
Then find out who's been listening,
who's involved in this,

00:15:11.119 --> 00:15:13.746
and how it connects
to my son's assassination.

00:15:13.830 --> 00:15:16.082
I'm his mother, I need to know.

00:15:16.666 --> 00:15:18.209
You're the only one I can trust.

00:15:18.835 --> 00:15:21.170
Right now, we can't trust Munju either.

00:15:23.422 --> 00:15:25.007
You understand what I'm saying?

00:15:26.509 --> 00:15:27.593
Yes, ma'am.

00:15:56.247 --> 00:15:59.208
Oh? What are you doing?

00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:02.795
Does Ms. Seo always leave leftovers?

00:16:02.879 --> 00:16:04.589
Ah… Mmm…

00:16:04.672 --> 00:16:08.176
Well, she's never really been
that big of an eater.

00:16:08.259 --> 00:16:10.303
She hates food that requires extra work.

00:16:10.386 --> 00:16:13.181
You know, like peeling shrimp
or picking out fish bones.

00:16:14.223 --> 00:16:16.225
I would guess
that's why that's still there.

00:16:16.309 --> 00:16:17.643
Extra work?

00:16:19.437 --> 00:16:21.230
She leaves food
on her plate because of that?

00:16:21.939 --> 00:16:23.774
Oh… It's not like that, though.

00:16:23.858 --> 00:16:27.445
Mmm… With the chicken in there whole…
Well, with the skin and the shape,

00:16:27.528 --> 00:16:29.572
it looks… kinda a little gross and weird

00:16:29.655 --> 00:16:31.908
- and she usually doesn't like that stuff.
- Gr…

00:16:32.408 --> 00:16:33.701
How could food be gross?

00:16:36.621 --> 00:16:39.373
Oh. That came out wrong, too.

00:16:39.457 --> 00:16:43.127
In all honesty, Ms. Seo
would not have my vote for President.

00:16:44.253 --> 00:16:45.421
Unbelievable.

00:16:46.005 --> 00:16:47.131
Just wasting food.

00:16:47.632 --> 00:16:49.258
Christ.

00:16:55.598 --> 00:16:58.517
THE NEW REPUBLICAN PARTY
AND GOYANG SPECIAL CITY JOINT RALLY

00:16:58.601 --> 00:17:01.729
Seo Munju!
Seo Munju! Seo Munju!

00:17:06.442 --> 00:17:08.236
I'll always remember that day.

00:17:08.861 --> 00:17:12.907
When my husband, Assemblyman Jang,
lay bleeding in my lap,

00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:15.368
I could see it.

00:17:16.118 --> 00:17:18.162
I could see the division between us.

00:17:18.246 --> 00:17:21.999
And I could see the crisis
surrounding the Korean Peninsula.

00:17:22.083 --> 00:17:25.503
In that moment, I was given a mission.

00:17:26.003 --> 00:17:27.171
Peace.

00:17:27.255 --> 00:17:29.757
It comes at a price.
It's something we have to fight for.

00:17:30.633 --> 00:17:33.678
I will reunite us and resolve this crisis.

00:17:33.761 --> 00:17:36.347
As President,
I will bring our country peace.

00:17:38.015 --> 00:17:40.351
Seo Munju!

00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:49.569
Second floor, section 5 on the right side.
Check the male in the aisle.

00:17:51.571 --> 00:17:53.823
That floor has been checked
and was given the all clear.

00:17:53.906 --> 00:17:55.157
Focus on your assigned area.

00:17:55.741 --> 00:17:57.660
Today, like that day,

00:17:57.743 --> 00:18:00.580
I will not back down.
And I won't in the days to come.

00:18:00.663 --> 00:18:02.582
No matter the danger that lies ahead…

00:18:02.665 --> 00:18:05.876
Give me all the intel you have.
What am I looking for?

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:08.421
I've given you all the intel
we have. Now, stay off comms.

00:18:08.504 --> 00:18:11.674
This frequency isn't secure.
I can't believe I have to tell you--

00:18:11.757 --> 00:18:14.427
…Lend me your strength.
And I promise that I will fight

00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:16.262
with that strength. Thanks, everyone.

00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:22.852
Seo Munju!

00:19:00.181 --> 00:19:01.807
Check that your side's secure.

00:19:19.408 --> 00:19:21.494
Man, you really killed it up there
like always.

00:19:21.577 --> 00:19:23.287
Listen to that crowd.

00:19:23.371 --> 00:19:26.749
You already hit over 200,000 views.

00:19:26.832 --> 00:19:28.709
You're going to be
the next Blue House superstar.

00:19:28.793 --> 00:19:30.211
It's that president lady!

00:19:30.711 --> 00:19:31.837
Hello!

00:19:31.921 --> 00:19:33.673
GOOD LUCK, SEO MUNJU
PRESIDENT SEO MUNJU

00:19:33.756 --> 00:19:35.174
Yay! We all love you, Seo Munju!

00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:38.219
- Seo Munju for president!
- Please keep that closed, ma'am.

00:19:38.844 --> 00:19:40.388
I love you, President Seo!

00:19:40.471 --> 00:19:41.722
Even for some kids?

00:19:43.683 --> 00:19:45.810
Seo Munju for president!

00:19:46.769 --> 00:19:48.479
Okay, bye-bye! See you!

00:20:18.342 --> 00:20:19.760
Turn around.

00:20:19.844 --> 00:20:20.845
What?

00:20:21.679 --> 00:20:24.432
- I can't turn in this lane.
- Turn around now!

00:20:24.515 --> 00:20:25.891
What's going on?

00:20:44.368 --> 00:20:46.328
- Keep moving. Don't stop the car!
- Sir.

00:21:38.756 --> 00:21:40.883
Gotta move.

00:21:55.606 --> 00:21:57.066
- Where's Ms. Seo?
- This way.

00:22:08.619 --> 00:22:10.412
- Get to the exit quickly!
- No pushing.

00:22:10.496 --> 00:22:11.539
Up the stairs!

00:22:12.790 --> 00:22:14.208
This way, this way!

00:22:17.169 --> 00:22:18.546
Watch your step!

00:22:22.216 --> 00:22:23.425
Here, hold your breath.

00:22:23.509 --> 00:22:24.760
Keep moving!

00:22:28.222 --> 00:22:29.223
Hurry!

00:22:44.113 --> 00:22:45.114
DANGER

00:22:49.451 --> 00:22:50.953
Turn your phone off now.

00:22:56.458 --> 00:22:58.168
POWER OFF

00:23:04.258 --> 00:23:07.261
{\an8}RESTRICTED AREA
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

00:23:07.344 --> 00:23:10.014
Breaking news,
at around 3:50 p.m.,

00:23:10.097 --> 00:23:12.516
a fire broke out at Samwol Station,

00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:14.894
possibly due to a gas explosion
at the construction site.

00:23:14.977 --> 00:23:17.521
- That looks really bad.
- We'll soon be connecting with the person

00:23:17.605 --> 00:23:18.939
who sent us this video.

00:23:19.023 --> 00:23:21.609
{\an8}- Was anyone hurt?
For more details on what happened…

00:23:21.692 --> 00:23:23.277
Hello, are you there?

00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:24.862
- Yes, hi.
- Thank you for sending…

00:23:24.945 --> 00:23:26.113
SECURITY HEAD PAIK SANHO

00:23:26.196 --> 00:23:27.531
Were you injured at all in the accident?

00:23:27.615 --> 00:23:29.408
The number you have dialed
is not in servi--

00:23:29.491 --> 00:23:30.743
CANDIDATE SEO MUNJU

00:23:30.826 --> 00:23:32.119
No, I'm fine.

00:23:32.202 --> 00:23:34.163
The number you have dialed
is not in service.

00:23:34.246 --> 00:23:35.748
…the accident has been reported…

00:23:35.831 --> 00:23:39.168
Changhee, thank god!

00:23:39.251 --> 00:23:40.669
Where's Ms. Seo?

00:23:40.753 --> 00:23:42.880
Mr. Paik, he moved her somewhere safe…

00:23:42.963 --> 00:23:44.673
- Where's Ms. Seo?
- …but I can't get in touch

00:23:44.757 --> 00:23:46.926
with either of them.

00:23:47.009 --> 00:23:49.053
Get the car,
we're heading there now.

00:23:49.136 --> 00:23:51.680
We have to send out all personnel
and start the search.

00:23:53.015 --> 00:23:55.768
If Mr. Paik interferes
with the candidate's safety in any way,

00:23:56.852 --> 00:23:58.604
you're authorized to take him out.

00:24:46.819 --> 00:24:48.821
How did you know
this would happen?

00:24:50.656 --> 00:24:52.408
Well, back at the rally site,

00:24:54.034 --> 00:24:55.327
I had a feeling.

00:24:56.328 --> 00:24:57.329
Thank you so much.

00:24:59.832 --> 00:25:01.667
I saw a man standing in the aisle,

00:25:02.376 --> 00:25:04.128
and he seemed out of place.

00:25:05.004 --> 00:25:06.964
I didn't know
where that feeling was coming from

00:25:07.047 --> 00:25:09.299
until I saw the kukri tattoo on his neck,

00:25:09.383 --> 00:25:10.926
the symbol of the Nepalese Gurkhas.

00:25:11.010 --> 00:25:13.012
The world's fiercest,
most ruthless soldiers.

00:25:13.095 --> 00:25:15.222
Report, confirming target.

00:25:16.140 --> 00:25:18.183
What do you think they were doing there?

00:25:20.853 --> 00:25:22.354
This is happening because of me.

00:25:25.357 --> 00:25:26.358
Isn't it?

00:25:40.956 --> 00:25:42.166
Keep pushing forward.

00:25:42.875 --> 00:25:43.917
Stay strong.

00:25:45.294 --> 00:25:46.837
We're only at the start, Munju.

00:25:54.053 --> 00:25:55.888
The start of a war.

00:26:34.426 --> 00:26:37.096
For safety reasons,

00:26:37.179 --> 00:26:39.389
trains are currently running through
without stopping.

00:26:39.473 --> 00:26:41.266
Thank you for your understanding.

00:26:48.065 --> 00:26:51.401
We've been waiting
for hours. Where have you been, Ms. Seo?

00:26:51.985 --> 00:26:53.278
I turned my phone off.

00:26:53.362 --> 00:26:54.905
We were concerned I would be tracked.

00:26:55.572 --> 00:26:56.615
Sorry I made you worry.

00:26:57.282 --> 00:26:59.910
Why don't you take
a seat here? Come.

00:27:00.410 --> 00:27:02.996
If you were concerned about
being tracked, why didn't you call me?

00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:05.374
You're upset because you don't trust me.

00:27:07.459 --> 00:27:08.794
I don't trust anyone either.

00:27:09.378 --> 00:27:10.671
You're telling me that

00:27:12.214 --> 00:27:13.966
you didn't call me
because you don't trust me?

00:27:14.049 --> 00:27:16.176
You didn't check the man
at the rally site.

00:27:16.969 --> 00:27:17.970
The one in the aisle.

00:27:19.263 --> 00:27:21.098
Second floor, with a ponytail.

00:27:21.181 --> 00:27:23.016
He was at the subway explosion.

00:27:24.685 --> 00:27:26.645
Do you believe that he's responsible?

00:27:28.730 --> 00:27:31.441
I was able to avoid the explosion
because I saw him.

00:27:31.525 --> 00:27:33.026
It's… It's, it's completely true.

00:27:33.527 --> 00:27:34.987
All of the sudden he began yelling,

00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:38.323
jerked the wheel
and spun the car around like a maniac.

00:27:38.407 --> 00:27:41.535
I thought he'd totally lost it.
Then one second later, the gas exploded.

00:27:41.618 --> 00:27:43.704
If we had kept going,
we would've blown up too!

00:27:44.413 --> 00:27:46.957
Nobody knows
you were at the explosion, Ms. Seo.

00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:49.710
I think it should stay that way,
at least while we plan our next steps

00:27:49.793 --> 00:27:51.086
based on the investigation.

00:27:51.169 --> 00:27:52.504
Going forward…

00:27:56.842 --> 00:27:58.468
I'll drive the car for Ms. Seo.

00:28:04.892 --> 00:28:07.019
I told you to give me the intel.

00:28:07.102 --> 00:28:09.021
She could've been killed today.

00:28:09.605 --> 00:28:11.231
You did a great job, Mark!

00:28:11.315 --> 00:28:13.025
That's why they call you the ace.

00:28:13.108 --> 00:28:15.277
You need to tell me everything right now.

00:28:15.777 --> 00:28:17.404
Who is the client?

00:28:17.487 --> 00:28:19.281
And what am I dealing with?

00:28:20.365 --> 00:28:22.242
We don't get to ask questions.

00:28:23.702 --> 00:28:25.245
We just follow orders.

00:28:25.954 --> 00:28:27.372
You've got me bugged.

00:28:27.456 --> 00:28:29.666
You're listening in on my conversations.

00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:30.918
And you're tracking me!

00:28:32.210 --> 00:28:35.172
Yeah. Well, that was the deal, my friend.

00:28:35.255 --> 00:28:37.841
You agreed to supply information on her.

00:28:40.344 --> 00:28:42.554
Changhee,
I didn't know you smoked.

00:28:43.138 --> 00:28:44.973
I managed to quit for ten years.

00:28:45.807 --> 00:28:47.267
Uh… Ms. Seo, I…

00:28:49.186 --> 00:28:51.146
There's something off about Mr. Paik.

00:28:53.649 --> 00:28:55.817
The report from the NIS on the bombing

00:28:55.901 --> 00:28:59.112
says an American defense contractor
called Coldrain was behind it.

00:28:59.196 --> 00:29:03.116
The same company where Secretary of
Defense Eagleton served as an adviser.

00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:05.827
Yeah, I talked to the president
a lot about you.

00:29:06.411 --> 00:29:10.374
How we've got to work with you disruptors
if we want to get things done.

00:29:10.457 --> 00:29:12.793
And its CEO is cousins
with the CEO of Valkyrie.

00:29:12.876 --> 00:29:14.294
It's an honor, sir.

00:29:14.378 --> 00:29:15.504
You take care now.

00:29:15.587 --> 00:29:19.591
I'm positive that we can find a link
between Mr. Paik and the attack.

00:29:20.467 --> 00:29:21.468
You know

00:29:22.469 --> 00:29:24.429
what I realized after the explosion?

00:29:25.514 --> 00:29:27.766
The only people who knew our planned route

00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:29.726
were the client

00:29:31.687 --> 00:29:33.021
and you.

00:29:33.605 --> 00:29:34.606
Mark.

00:29:36.233 --> 00:29:38.193
This is a dream job for guys like us.

00:29:39.111 --> 00:29:42.447
One more month and you can retire, man.

00:29:44.074 --> 00:29:47.744
Tell your client
they can take the money back.

00:29:48.704 --> 00:29:49.788
I'm done.

00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:03.593
Ms. Seo, I just keep thinking

00:30:04.511 --> 00:30:06.930
that he didn't actually help you
avoid the accident.

00:30:07.014 --> 00:30:09.349
You got caught up in this
because of this guy

00:30:09.433 --> 00:30:11.727
and because
trouble follows him everywhere.

00:30:14.354 --> 00:30:15.814
And then this place too.

00:30:15.897 --> 00:30:19.067
A little suspicious that the perfect spot
shows up right when we need it.

00:30:19.693 --> 00:30:22.863
According to the register,
it's owned by a corporation called KCR.

00:30:22.946 --> 00:30:25.699
I looked into it.
Turns out, it's a shell company.

00:30:26.491 --> 00:30:28.660
That morning, a text from the owner
came to the agent

00:30:28.744 --> 00:30:32.289
saying the house was going on the market
but they hadn't spoken in years.

00:30:32.372 --> 00:30:34.374
Miji talked to the agent right after.

00:30:35.709 --> 00:30:37.794
This whole thing is very concerning.

00:30:41.381 --> 00:30:43.425
Let's just both keep an eye on him.

00:30:44.468 --> 00:30:46.053
I have reasons.

00:30:46.136 --> 00:30:47.179
I'm being careful.

00:30:48.889 --> 00:30:50.807
I need your help and your trust.

00:31:27.302 --> 00:31:29.513
BEDROOM

00:31:32.557 --> 00:31:34.559
SEPTEMBER 23RD

00:31:40.190 --> 00:31:43.568
You know, things are really great
right now with you and I.

00:31:43.652 --> 00:31:47.197
I'm sure in ten or 20 years,
when I look back on my life,

00:31:47.989 --> 00:31:50.742
I'll probably say
this was the happiest time.

00:31:51.618 --> 00:31:52.953
That makes me sad.

00:31:53.829 --> 00:31:54.830
Why?

00:31:55.789 --> 00:31:57.499
What if, 10 years from now,

00:31:59.042 --> 00:32:01.795
I get lost and can't find my way
back to happiness?

00:32:03.839 --> 00:32:05.507
He was a spy.

00:32:09.136 --> 00:32:11.263
I killed the spy.

00:32:11.346 --> 00:32:13.223
"I killed the spy," he said.

00:32:17.686 --> 00:32:19.020
The truth is

00:32:19.104 --> 00:32:22.732
in the months leading up to his death,
your son was being watched by us

00:32:23.859 --> 00:32:25.610
under suspicion of treason.

00:32:26.111 --> 00:32:29.114
The thing is,
I know who my husband is.

00:32:29.197 --> 00:32:31.241
He may have been foolish at times.

00:32:32.951 --> 00:32:34.578
But he wasn't a spy.

00:32:35.537 --> 00:32:38.248
The truth around Junik's death
will come out.

00:33:34.095 --> 00:33:35.096
Yes?

00:33:42.729 --> 00:33:43.730
Ah…

00:33:45.357 --> 00:33:46.358
Sorry.

00:33:47.108 --> 00:33:50.695
Even a sniper needs
to get some sleep, right?

00:33:53.490 --> 00:33:54.741
Did I wake you?

00:33:56.534 --> 00:33:58.912
I sleep pretty light whenever I'm on duty.

00:34:04.125 --> 00:34:05.794
What's wrong? Why are you up?

00:34:08.838 --> 00:34:10.507
It was a dream, that's all.

00:34:15.971 --> 00:34:18.306
Now that I'm awake,
reality feels more like

00:34:19.516 --> 00:34:20.850
a nightmare.

00:34:21.434 --> 00:34:23.436
I hope I'm not the cause of all this.

00:34:28.108 --> 00:34:29.109
Wanna go run?

00:35:13.695 --> 00:35:15.196
Hey. About the house,

00:35:16.323 --> 00:35:18.158
you had something to do with it, right?

00:35:19.868 --> 00:35:21.870
Yeah, the house is owned by Catacomb.

00:35:22.662 --> 00:35:24.414
It's optimized for security.

00:35:26.291 --> 00:35:27.959
I told them what's going on,

00:35:28.043 --> 00:35:30.337
and was assured
they'd have it ready for you quickly.

00:35:30.420 --> 00:35:32.964
I could tell
there were things you hadn't told me.

00:35:33.757 --> 00:35:35.008
That much I knew.

00:35:38.595 --> 00:35:41.014
Then why did you hire me
as your bodyguard?

00:35:42.098 --> 00:35:44.059
Well, if someone's gonna kill me,

00:35:45.393 --> 00:35:47.937
I would prefer to see the assassin
come at me head on

00:35:48.021 --> 00:35:49.648
instead of lurking in the dark.

00:35:49.731 --> 00:35:53.652
So I'd know exactly who's after me
and why they want me dead.

00:35:56.279 --> 00:35:59.324
Repeatedly saving someone's life
only to kill them later.

00:36:00.325 --> 00:36:02.202
I'd make a pretty inefficient assassin.

00:36:02.285 --> 00:36:04.663
That's true.

00:36:09.292 --> 00:36:10.627
Let's get something clear.

00:36:11.211 --> 00:36:12.587
You can keep saving my life,

00:36:12.671 --> 00:36:15.465
but no matter how often you do,

00:36:16.216 --> 00:36:17.550
I'll never trust you.

00:36:21.179 --> 00:36:22.681
I won't let that bother me.

00:36:23.390 --> 00:36:25.225
I'll just keep doing what I'm here for.

00:36:31.022 --> 00:36:32.273
Let me ask you this.

00:36:34.734 --> 00:36:36.903
If someone had actually
taken a shot at me,

00:36:37.487 --> 00:36:40.281
you would've taken the bullet for me.

00:36:41.366 --> 00:36:42.701
Is that right?

00:36:50.250 --> 00:36:52.752
That's what we're trained for,
as bodyguards.

00:37:04.305 --> 00:37:06.474
I suppose
I won't be needing this necklace.

00:37:10.895 --> 00:37:12.939
Since you're the one protecting me…

00:37:14.941 --> 00:37:17.110
it should be around your neck instead.

00:37:25.118 --> 00:37:30.081
I found these in Mr. Jang's
bedroom, the study, and also the hallway.

00:37:30.165 --> 00:37:32.041
I didn't find any others anywhere else.

00:37:32.709 --> 00:37:34.794
The fact that they even planted these…

00:37:35.336 --> 00:37:38.465
Does that mean that
someone in my family was involved?

00:37:40.467 --> 00:37:42.177
I found files from the bugs

00:37:43.178 --> 00:37:45.555
on Prosecutor Junsang Jang's computer.

00:37:49.684 --> 00:37:51.227
Junsang did this?

00:37:58.985 --> 00:38:00.236
It's all my fault.

00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:04.157
When he was growing up,
I didn't give him enough affection.

00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:05.617
He's not bad deep down, though.

00:38:06.326 --> 00:38:10.246
Fortunately, there's no evidence that
Junik was a spy for North Korea,

00:38:10.330 --> 00:38:11.372
at least not yet.

00:38:16.294 --> 00:38:17.295
You know,

00:38:19.130 --> 00:38:20.965
something does worry me,

00:38:22.091 --> 00:38:23.551
a thought I can't get rid of.

00:38:24.511 --> 00:38:28.139
So Junik happens to write a will

00:38:28.223 --> 00:38:31.768
stating that he plans to leave everything
he owns to his wife.

00:38:33.102 --> 00:38:34.813
Then, two weeks later,

00:38:35.396 --> 00:38:37.023
he's assassinated.

00:38:39.734 --> 00:38:41.861
Who would you suspect was the killer?

00:38:42.654 --> 00:38:43.655
You're saying

00:38:44.489 --> 00:38:47.200
Ms. Seo was the only beneficiary
of the will?

00:38:49.744 --> 00:38:51.704
No matter how much I want to trust her,

00:38:52.497 --> 00:38:54.582
it just makes my blood boil.

00:38:58.294 --> 00:39:00.255
A strong, intelligent man

00:39:01.005 --> 00:39:03.174
who any woman would want to rely on…

00:39:06.302 --> 00:39:08.096
Munju comes to life when…

00:39:08.805 --> 00:39:10.431
when she's with that man.

00:39:11.599 --> 00:39:12.976
She seems happy.

00:39:17.397 --> 00:39:18.857
Though sometimes,

00:39:19.566 --> 00:39:22.402
I want to look through her phone.
The temptation's too great.

00:39:23.361 --> 00:39:25.864
Ma'am, are you asking me
to spy on Ms. Seo?

00:39:28.491 --> 00:39:30.410
If you take care of this for me,

00:39:30.493 --> 00:39:32.662
there'll be plenty of opportunities
I can give you.

00:39:39.711 --> 00:39:40.753
Give me your hand.

00:39:51.681 --> 00:39:55.935
Nothing more valuable than a young
professional who excels at his work.

00:40:06.571 --> 00:40:07.572
Dear Lord,

00:40:08.489 --> 00:40:10.909
please look after the soul of Father Yang.

00:40:12.076 --> 00:40:14.704
And forgive even the smallest of his sins,

00:40:15.580 --> 00:40:17.081
and be with him, always.

00:40:17.874 --> 00:40:20.543
And Lord, please bestow your mercy

00:40:21.169 --> 00:40:24.505
upon Seo Munju
and forgive her sins as well.

00:40:30.511 --> 00:40:31.554
Amen.

00:40:41.105 --> 00:40:42.106
This lady…

00:40:44.359 --> 00:40:46.319
just doesn't seem to realize…

00:40:49.197 --> 00:40:52.575
the unforgivable sin of wasting good food.

00:41:21.187 --> 00:41:23.147
{\an8}PARK CHANGHEE

00:41:32.532 --> 00:41:33.533
Yes, Mr. Park.

00:41:33.616 --> 00:41:35.076
I found it.

00:41:35.159 --> 00:41:36.202
Found what?

00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:39.163
Assemblyman Jang's secret phone.

00:41:41.207 --> 00:41:44.085
I got a message about
an overdue phone bill, so I checked.

00:41:46.879 --> 00:41:49.966
Turns out, there was
another phone registered under my name.

00:41:50.049 --> 00:41:51.551
MY PHONE INFO

00:41:51.634 --> 00:41:53.011
I knew right away,

00:41:53.511 --> 00:41:56.222
it had to be Mr. Jang
who'd set it up that way.

00:41:56.305 --> 00:41:58.599
But, sir,
may I ask you what this is about?

00:42:00.852 --> 00:42:02.562
A squirrel is following us.

00:42:07.775 --> 00:42:10.737
Then I remembered
seeing him use a phone I didn't recognize.

00:42:10.820 --> 00:42:13.406
I tracked its location
and it seemed to be in his car.

00:42:34.260 --> 00:42:37.096
We can access
the encrypted emails with this, can't we?

00:42:37.180 --> 00:42:39.682
I'll try.
I have to unlock the phone first.

00:42:39.766 --> 00:42:41.225
Can you do that?

00:42:41.309 --> 00:42:44.062
I know some of
the combinations Mr. Jang used,

00:42:44.145 --> 00:42:46.022
so if I run those
through an algorithm-based program,

00:42:46.105 --> 00:42:48.024
I should be able to crack it by noon.

00:43:03.623 --> 00:43:04.832
Yes.

00:43:41.244 --> 00:43:44.497
{\an8}RESETTING THIS PC

00:43:48.751 --> 00:43:50.044
Hmm?

00:43:51.087 --> 00:43:52.338
What the…

00:43:53.506 --> 00:43:56.050
Did he unlock that phone already?

00:44:04.809 --> 00:44:07.061
The person you have dialed
is not in service.

00:44:07.145 --> 00:44:08.146
Hmm?

00:44:16.737 --> 00:44:17.738
Hmm?

00:44:39.260 --> 00:44:40.761
How recently did Changhee leave?

00:44:40.845 --> 00:44:43.139
More than 30 minutes ago,
I think.

00:44:43.222 --> 00:44:44.765
LET'S GET A FEW BASIC THINGS
OUT OF THE WAY

00:44:47.226 --> 00:44:49.312
He formatted the drive
before he left.

00:45:05.953 --> 00:45:07.663
The person you have dialed
is not in service…

00:45:07.747 --> 00:45:09.790
Shit.

00:45:27.391 --> 00:45:28.726
What happened?

00:45:36.567 --> 00:45:38.277
Changhee, are you okay?

00:45:38.361 --> 00:45:40.571
No! No!

00:45:40.655 --> 00:45:41.864
Changhee!

00:45:43.491 --> 00:45:44.659
Changhee.

00:45:45.201 --> 00:45:46.452
Changhee, you'll be okay.

00:45:47.453 --> 00:45:49.789
Ma'am, I'm sorry.
This is as far as you can go.

00:45:50.331 --> 00:45:51.999
- Ms. Seo…
- Oh, Changhee.

00:45:52.083 --> 00:45:53.209
Ms. Seo…

00:45:57.463 --> 00:45:59.840
I think that Assemblyman Jang

00:46:01.175 --> 00:46:03.427
might actually have been a spy.

00:46:37.878 --> 00:46:40.423
I should've just gone
after the truck.

00:46:43.467 --> 00:46:46.804
Oh, that's right.
I found this near the accident.

00:46:46.887 --> 00:46:50.391
Is this
Mr. Jang's secret phone?

00:46:57.523 --> 00:46:58.524
WELCOME!

00:47:01.777 --> 00:47:03.696
Looks like he reset the phone too.

00:47:08.034 --> 00:47:09.452
What was my husband hiding?

00:47:11.412 --> 00:47:15.124
I don't know,
but what did Changhee say to you earlier?

00:47:27.011 --> 00:47:28.846
{\an8}14-4 HYORIMRO 7-GIL

00:47:33.809 --> 00:47:35.227
FRONT DOOR PASSCODE 0814

00:47:38.981 --> 00:47:41.067
I'M MOVING OUT TOMORROW,
SO YOU SHOULD COME TODAY

00:48:16.644 --> 00:48:18.270
Do you really need to go in there?

00:48:19.897 --> 00:48:21.023
Ms. Seo.

00:48:25.319 --> 00:48:26.404
I can open it.

00:50:38.202 --> 00:50:39.453
Mom.

00:50:40.037 --> 00:50:41.872
Someone is in our house.
