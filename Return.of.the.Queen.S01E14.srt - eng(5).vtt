00:01:58.479 --> 00:01:59.350
Sorry.

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:00.510
Siyu.

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:01.920
You're back.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.000
I left something here.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.130
I came back to get it.

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:06.400
Since you left,

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.070
Ms. Ye

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:08.360
asked me to tidy up the house.

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:08.960
I still

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.220
haven't finished yet.

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:11.800
Well,

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.060
let me help you with it.

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.750
No need.

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.080
These are all Ms. Ye's things.

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.210
I'll take care of it.

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:31.360
This is...

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.590
This belongs to Ms. Ye.

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:35.910
She said she lost one a few years ago,

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:36.910
so she asked me to put this one

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:38.310
in the storage room.

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:41.190
She herself said

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.720
she lost one a few years ago?

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:45.040
When did she lose it?

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.150
Where did she lose it?

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:47.030
I don't know.

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:48.079
But this earring

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:49.740
definitely belongs to Ms. Ye.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.930
All her accessories are custom-made.

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:53.470
The back of all her earrings

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:54.930
have her initials on them.

At Lu Sinan's funeral.

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:29.830
At the entrance of Mare Nubium.

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:34.310
It was me.

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:36.690
Who on earth are you?

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:43.600
This lady and I

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:44.750
have something to talk about.

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:45.310
As for you,

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:46.560
take your dad's photo

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:47.390
and go upstairs.

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:48.630
Okay, Mom.

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:49.800
Go ahead now.

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:04.830
I am Lu Sinan's wife.

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:11.900
The boy you just saw is Lu Junxuan.

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:16.360
He is Sinan's

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:18.420
only son in this world.

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:23.160
If you are Lu Sinan's wife,

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:26.510
then who am I?

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:28.870
You are his legally wedded spouse

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:31.160
in this country.

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:32.510
But I

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:36.310
am his real wife.

00:06:49.159 --> 00:06:50.560
Lu Sinan.

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:53.870
You sound so affectionate.

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:54.950
Did

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:57.240
you miss me?

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:16.000
Lu Sinan.

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:19.510
Didn't I already tell you

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:21.170
the professor went over time?

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:23.520
Why did you wait here for so long?

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:25.480
I can't eat without you.

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:26.480
Look.

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:28.000
I've lost weight waiting for you.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.530
You're such a sweet talker.

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:32.310
Look what good stuff

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:33.310
I've brought you!

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:34.030
What is it?

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:39.530
Choose one.

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:41.400
This one.

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:49.270
Slow down.

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:51.600
Eating too fast is bad for your digestion.

00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:56.159
Oh right.

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:01.600
What's this?

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:03.240
This is the pork rib soup

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:04.640
I got from Cafeteria One.

00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:08.850
Isn't this your favorite?

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:09.870
I love it.

00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:27.350
Have some.

00:08:33.669 --> 00:08:34.440
Jingmin.

00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:37.480
Why are you so good to me?

00:08:38.909 --> 00:08:40.480
If I lost you someday,

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:43.150
what should I do?

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:53.000
What should you do?

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:14.320
Jingmin.

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:17.320
Go abroad with me.

00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:22.390
Abroad?

00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:26.510
Where will we go?

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.600
Let's go to a place

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.440
where nobody knows us.

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:33.030
Then we'll buy a house.

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:34.670
We'll build

00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:36.470
a little home that's just for us.

00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:38.880
Then we'll get married.

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:40.510
We'll have

00:09:40.510 --> 00:09:41.550
our very own

00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:42.480
adorable child.

00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:44.670
Isn't this

00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:46.670
a bit

00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:48.240
too abrupt?

00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:00.550
I know

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:02.720
I shouldn't be proposing

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:03.720
to you so hastily.

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:06.550
But this is something

00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:09.960
I've thought about for a long time.

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:11.120
You know,

00:10:12.510 --> 00:10:13.840
when I was six years old,

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:17.520
my mother passed away
after a long illness.

00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:20.750
The funeral wasn't even over

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:23.360
when my stepmother moved in
with my stepsister

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:24.960
and my newborn stepbrother.

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:27.030
All these years,

00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:30.150
I've always hated that home.

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:35.200
I want to leave

00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:37.720
and never come back.

00:10:46.270 --> 00:10:47.120
Sinan.

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:48.790
Jingmin.

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:51.120
I'll give you everything I have.

00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:52.810
I will love you forever,

00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:54.300
love our children,

00:10:55.390 --> 00:10:56.790
and love only our family.

00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:10.790
Will you

00:11:13.270 --> 00:11:14.080
come with me?

00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:35.670
I will.

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:50.000
Baby,

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:50.730
look at this.

00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:51.640
What's this?

00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:54.520
Do you like it?

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:23.510
Sinan said

00:12:26.390 --> 00:12:27.270
those two years

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:31.080
were his happiest time.

00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:33.630
He also said

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:37.570
he would protect us
with everything he had

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:39.910
and he would

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.200
never leave us.

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:44.870
When Junxuan turned two,

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:47.600
he suddenly told me

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:50.210
the Lu family had an emergency,

00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:52.080
and he had to

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:53.880
rush back to deal with it.

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:56.210
So we agreed on a one-year term.

00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:57.670
He promised me

00:12:57.670 --> 00:12:58.800
that after one year,

00:12:58.870 --> 00:13:00.630
he would sort everything out

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:02.750
and never leave us again.

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:04.620
Thinking about it now,

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.460
I realize that he probably

00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:08.670
flew back just to marry you.

00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:16.200
I've asked him about it.

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:19.240
I asked him why.

00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:24.480
He only told me

00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:26.480
to trust him.

00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:27.510
He said he had never

00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:28.870
betrayed us.

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:31.120
He had also never

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:31.750
fallen in love with

00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:33.240
anyone but me.

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:35.510
He also said

00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:37.550
he would definitely

00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:38.750
return to us.

00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:48.080
After he came back,

00:13:50.750 --> 00:13:52.150
did you two stay in touch?

00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:55.020
After he returned,

00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:57.250
we contacted each other every day,

00:13:57.670 --> 00:13:58.440
even when you were

00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:00.040
on your honeymoon in Monaco.

00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:33.550
Actually,

00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:35.440
I really don't know

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:37.170
what happened between you two.

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:39.660
But since you're here now,

00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:41.870
could you please tell me

00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:43.670
how Sinan actually passed away?

00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:44.840
And also,

00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:46.080
what exactly

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.670
happened between you two?

00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:50.320
I...

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:52.080
Could I bring Junxuan

00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:53.080
to see him?

00:14:54.270 --> 00:14:55.720
We've been turned away

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:57.320
from two funerals already.

00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:58.080
Please, I'm begging you.

00:14:58.080 --> 00:14:58.390
Please.

00:14:58.390 --> 00:14:59.250
Don't touch me!

00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:28.000
I came to see

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:31.120
who took the money

00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:34.200
but still refuses to leave.

00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:41.910
I didn't take

00:15:42.910 --> 00:15:43.750
your money.

00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:45.750
So

00:15:47.750 --> 00:15:48.870
I'm not leaving.

00:15:50.670 --> 00:15:51.390
What?

00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:54.120
You want to bring that boy

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:55.380
to claim his heritage?

00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:56.630
You...

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:58.960
Don't you think

00:16:00.910 --> 00:16:03.200
you need to explain to me first?

00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:11.870
[Medical Devices]

00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:12.550
Okay.

00:16:13.870 --> 00:16:15.200
What do you want to hear?

00:16:15.790 --> 00:16:16.750
How about

00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:19.270
the romantic history

00:16:19.510 --> 00:16:21.320
of the Lu family's eldest son?

00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:23.080
Or maybe

00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:25.550
about his suddenly appearing

00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:26.550
son?

00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:28.120
Ye Haimeng.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.670
Didn't you always claim

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:33.660
that you were completely done
with Lu Sinan?

00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:34.960
So why are you now

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:37.550
swaggering in front

00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:39.270
of his wife and kid?

00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:48.720
So you knew all along

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:50.380
that Lu Sinan had been married

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.030
and had

00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:54.440
a son abroad.

00:16:59.790 --> 00:17:00.390
Then why

00:17:00.390 --> 00:17:02.050
did you let him get close to me?

00:17:03.510 --> 00:17:04.349
Why did you let him

00:17:04.349 --> 00:17:05.790
be in a relationship with me?

00:17:05.790 --> 00:17:07.550
Why did you let him marry me?

00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:09.240
Why?

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:13.160
You can't possibly think

00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:14.589
that you're prettier,

00:17:14.589 --> 00:17:15.510
gentler,

00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:16.240
or

00:17:17.109 --> 00:17:18.069
better

00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:22.640
at giving Sinan sons than Ms. Bai, right?

00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:31.070
Ye Haimeng.

00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:34.880
What do you think

00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:36.790
made Lu Sinan

00:17:36.790 --> 00:17:37.830
marry you?

00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:41.600
It was only because you're the Ye family's

00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:43.510
only daughter.

00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:53.440
That's it.

00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:54.650
That's good.

00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:56.550
I never expected

00:17:56.830 --> 00:17:58.400
that for the Ye family's daughter,

00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:00.640
you would go to such great lengths.

00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:03.170
If I'm trying
to take all her family's wealth,

00:18:03.310 --> 00:18:05.110
relying on just a few sweet words

00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:06.590
is far too insincere.

00:18:09.030 --> 00:18:10.510
Did I underestimate you?

00:18:11.110 --> 00:18:12.790
You're my father's wife

00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:15.680
and always the matriarch of the Lu family.

00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:17.110
Whatever anyone in this family

00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:18.110
says or does,

00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:19.510
you see it all.

00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:23.440
However,

00:18:25.310 --> 00:18:26.920
regarding our agreement,

00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:30.680
I'll only fulfill this one part.

00:18:30.830 --> 00:18:31.550
No problem.

00:18:32.110 --> 00:18:33.200
As long as you take

00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:35.000
all the wealth of the Ye family's

00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:36.790
only daughter,

00:18:36.790 --> 00:18:38.510
I'll help you hide your wife

00:18:38.510 --> 00:18:39.790
and child from your father.

00:18:39.790 --> 00:18:40.790
Once it's done,

00:18:40.790 --> 00:18:41.920
I'll transfer 50% of it

00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:42.510

00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:44.110

to start a new life.

00:18:50.110 --> 00:18:50.920
Deal.

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:53.680
When you see Ye Haimeng,

00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:57.960
will you feel guilty?

00:18:57.960 --> 00:18:59.400
No need to say that.

00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:02.880
I have no feelings

00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:06.440
for her.

Stop trying.

00:19:50.550 --> 00:19:52.240
These can't be the secret ledgers.

00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:53.070
The other day,

00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:54.000
you and I checked this

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:54.790
at the archives room.

00:19:54.790 --> 00:19:56.400
All accounts balanced perfectly.

00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:57.590
These USB drives

00:19:57.590 --> 00:19:58.310
were found

00:19:58.310 --> 00:19:59.920
in a hidden drawer compartment.

00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:01.270
If they were not the secret ledgers,

00:20:01.270 --> 00:20:02.110
why would they

00:20:02.110 --> 00:20:03.590
be hidden in a secret compartment?

00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:04.680
Those records in the archives room

00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:06.240
are so perfect

00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:07.720
that they're actually suspicious.

00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:08.400
Otherwise,

00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:10.110
there must be another set

00:20:10.110 --> 00:20:11.170
of secret ledgers.

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:13.310
Instead of staying here

00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:14.440
guessing and testing,

00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:15.350
you might as well

00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:16.200
call your dad,

00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:17.400
or go back directly

00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:19.060
to ask him to come to my office.

00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:19.880

Sometimes kindness

00:20:23.110 --> 00:20:24.310
is not just kindness.

00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:26.000
It is also called

00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:28.070
weakness.

00:20:30.110 --> 00:20:31.550
I've never been weak.

He is my adoptive father.

00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:36.400

he has always been good to me.

00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:41.240
These past few years,

00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:42.480
he has gotten older

00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:43.000
and experienced

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:44.530
Haimeng's father's death.

00:20:44.590 --> 00:20:45.400
I admit

00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:47.270
I've been somewhat compliant with him.

00:20:47.270 --> 00:20:48.720
But this can't be called

00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:49.680
weakness.

00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:50.790
That's not compliance.

00:20:50.790 --> 00:20:52.030
Your compliance with him

00:20:52.030 --> 00:20:52.790
has long gone beyond

00:20:52.790 --> 00:20:54.000
the father-son relationship.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:54.680
You've always been

00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:56.160
submissive to him.

00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:56.830
You never dare

00:20:56.830 --> 00:20:58.030
to disobey his words.

00:20:58.350 --> 00:20:59.400
It's not filial piety.

00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:00.510
It's not respect.

00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:01.840
It's people-pleasing.

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:03.160
Ye Bochen,

00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:05.120
haven't you realized

00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:06.940
you're a people-pleaser?

00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:09.120
It's because you know

00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:10.590
you're the Ye family’s foster son

00:21:10.590 --> 00:21:11.830
that you've spent

00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:12.400
your whole life

your adoptive parents happy.

00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:16.440
Because only in this way

00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:17.920
can you live in the Ye family

00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:19.640
safely and securely.

You've gone too far with your words.

For the past few days,

00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:26.480

from the past 5 years

00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:30.310
or even 10 years.

00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:31.510
I really don't know

00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:32.880
what you're looking for.

00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:33.880
Do you absolutely need to find

00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:35.070
something wrong
with the Engineering Department

00:21:35.070 --> 00:21:36.680
before you let this go?

00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:37.310
I've worked in the Engineering Department

as a manager for 4 or 5 years.

00:21:39.030 --> 00:21:41.160
Even if the Engineering Department
made some mistakes,

even serious ones,

00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:44.110
I should take full responsibility.

But now

no such thing as marriage,

00:31:44.550 --> 00:31:46.550
and no such thing as true affection.

00:31:47.590 --> 00:31:48.310
Haimeng.

00:31:49.790 --> 00:31:50.790
I'm not sad.

00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:53.000
I just feel

00:31:55.640 --> 00:31:56.440
relieved.

00:31:58.240 --> 00:31:59.300
Don't be like this.

00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:04.640
So it turns out you and I

00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:06.100
have no connection at all.

00:32:07.110 --> 00:32:08.920
I'm not your brother's wife.

00:32:10.270 --> 00:32:11.480
I'm just

00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:16.400
the prey in his hunting plan

00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:19.810
and the stepping stone for his escape.

00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:34.590
If you're feeling sad,

00:32:35.270 --> 00:32:36.400
then say it out loud.

00:32:36.790 --> 00:32:37.640
Just say it.

00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:38.720
I'll listen.

00:32:39.790 --> 00:32:41.120
If you hate the Lu family

00:32:41.790 --> 00:32:42.790
and hate Lu Sinan,

00:32:43.510 --> 00:32:44.480
take it out on me.

00:32:45.590 --> 00:32:47.320
This has nothing to do with you.

00:32:53.310 --> 00:32:54.750
This is the cost

00:32:54.750 --> 00:32:55.880
of my blind trust

00:32:56.830 --> 00:32:58.290
and foolish infatuation.

00:33:01.030 --> 00:33:01.920
Lu Siyu.

00:33:04.350 --> 00:33:05.280
It hurts so much.

00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:06.170
It hurts?

00:33:08.030 --> 00:33:09.090
Where does it hurt?

00:33:09.510 --> 00:33:11.440
Is your old injury acting up again?

00:33:12.110 --> 00:33:13.160
Where's your medicine?

00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:14.200
Did you bring any?

00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:16.270
I bought you some painkillers last time.

00:33:16.270 --> 00:33:17.930
I don't want to take medicine.

00:33:18.310 --> 00:33:19.240
It's too bitter.

00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:38.680
You once said

00:33:41.510 --> 00:33:43.550
if the medicine is bitter,

00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:45.200
the work is tough,

00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:47.160
or the life is hard,

00:33:48.790 --> 00:33:50.920
just unwrap one candy and eat it.

00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:52.310
Now,

00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:54.720
can I have one?

00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:56.890
Yes, you can.

00:33:57.400 --> 00:33:58.400
Of course you can.

00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:15.060
Is it sweet?
